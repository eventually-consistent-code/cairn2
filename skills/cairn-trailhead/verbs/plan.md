Plan the given phase per the `cairn-planning` skill's depth dial.

0. `plan_tracker_delta()` — peek. Anything in the delta → say so in one
   line ("tracker delta: 2 new, 1 edited — `/cairn:resync` to integrate")
   and continue; a non-empty delta never blocks this verb. First run:
   the tool initializes silently, don't mention it.
1. `plan_status()` — confirm the phase dir exists (else `plan_scaffold_phase` first;
   deep depth passes `research: true`).
2. Depth (flag > PLAN.md frontmatter `depth:` > cairn.json default > standard):
   - quick: no research; draft PLAN.md tasks directly.
   - standard: one research subagent for unknowns; write RESEARCH.md if material.
   - deep: parallel research fan-out per the skill's model-routing rubric, then a
     plan-checker pass over the draft (deep also convenes the challenge
     round — step 4 — alongside that pass).
   - When a map exists, research also consults `map_query` for the phase
     slice (`node: <phase-N id>` or a `label` match on the phase name,
     `depth: 2`) — dependencies and owners the graph already knows beat
     rediscovering them. Missing map: silently skip (rule in `map.md`).
3. Write the task breakdown into the phase's PLAN.md body. Keep decisions in
   CONTEXT.md (precedence per shared rules — the tracker gets updated, not
   followed).
   - **Approaches considered — BEFORE the task breakdown, at every depth
     but quick.** Name the phase's central design fork and write
     CONTEXT.md's `## Approaches considered` block: two-plus `### `
     candidates, each with a line of trade-offs, and one `chosen: <X> —
     because <why>` line. Vibe mode drafts the candidates itself; engineer
     mode folds them into this verb's single interview question (the
     user picks or adds). `plan_check` flags a planned, non-quick phase
     whose CONTEXT.md lacks the block (`missing-approaches`) — the
     divergent-design step is a data shape, not a habit. When the chosen
     approach rests on an assumption the repo can't settle (a library
     behavior, a platform limit, a performance guess), STOP before
     PLAN.md: hand the question to `probe "<question>"` (verbs/probe.md),
     write `chosen: pending probe <id>` in the block, and resume this
     verb when the probe wraps — a plan built on a hunch is the thing
     the block exists to prevent.
   - Estimate every issue this verb creates (`issue_create` here and in
     steps 5–6): `estimatePoints` from task complexity (quick/mechanical
     1–2, standard 3–5, deep/cross-cutting 8), `estimateMinutes` as an
     honest wall-clock guess. Backends without estimate fields ignore them
     silently — always pass both. Worklog on close records the actual;
     together they make burndown/velocity/estimate-vs-actual reports real.
   - A task MAY name a roster seat for dispatch framing: end the task's
     first line with a backticked `` `seat: <name>` `` annotation, where
     `<name>` is a kebab-case seat name from `seat_roster` — at most one
     per task. `work` reads it when composing that issue's wave brief
     from `templates/wave-brief.md`; a name matching no valid roster
     seat is noted and the brief goes out seatless. No annotation = the
     plain templated brief — annotate only when a seat's lens genuinely
     fits the task, never by default.
4. Challenge round — runs ONLY when `--challenge` was passed OR the
   resolved depth is deep (where it joins the plan-checker pass);
   otherwise skip this step entirely — with no flag at standard depth,
   plan behaves byte-for-byte as today. Advisory, never a gate: the
   user's plan always wins.
   - `seat_roster` once — the valid plan-stage seats (`stage` plan or
     `any`, the `seatsForStage(roster, "plan")` filter) are the
     challenge panel, in roster order; with the shipped defaults that
     is exactly the interrogation seat. Internal seats are framing
     lenses — cheap, same-model; `peers` remains the genuinely
     adversarial external council. No plan-stage seats on the roster →
     say so in one line and move on.
   - Convene each seat over the draft PLAN.md + CONTEXT.md, framed at
     its declared dose via the wave-brief composition
     (`templates/wave-brief.md`: seat framing per dose in the seat
     slot, the challenge charge as the task, the draft artifacts as
     the plan excerpt) — composed agent-side from `seat_roster` and
     the template, exactly like `work`'s briefs: zero new tools, zero
     server changes.
   - Collect the seats' challenges as PROPOSED AMENDMENTS — each names
     the PLAN.md/CONTEXT.md line it targets and the question that line
     cannot answer — and put them to the user in ONE batched
     AskUserQuestion, never one-per-amendment.
   - Accepted amendments edit PLAN.md/CONTEXT.md; where task lists
     change, the edits flow through `plan_issues_set` / `plan_meta_set`,
     never hand-edits. Rejected amendments are recorded in CONTEXT.md
     with a one-line reason each — a written why, not a silent drop.
5. Flags (combinable; all task-list changes still flow through `plan_issues_set`
   / `plan_meta_set`, never hand-edits):
   - `--mvp`: shape tasks per the cairn-planning skill's vertical-slice-first
     policy before writing PLAN.md.
   - `--prd <file>`: read the file first; interview ONLY the gaps it leaves,
     batched into one AskUserQuestion.
   - `--ingest <glob>`: read matching docs; write their decisions into
     CONTEXT.md as locked decisions with source links. Conflicting docs →
     surface the conflict, never silently pick.
   - `--tdd`: per task, judge eligibility per the cairn-planning rubric;
     batch the proposed eligible/ineligible split into ONE AskUserQuestion
     for overrides; then `plan_meta_set(phaseDir, tdd: [<eligible ids>])`.
   - `--gaps`: read this phase's VERIFICATION.md failures + the latest
     `plan_resync` report — plus the phase's `map_query` slice when a map
     exists (depth 2 from the phase node): an edge into unfinished work is
     a gap candidate too. Propose new/amended tasks. Goal-breaking gaps →
     issues in this phase now (`issue_create` + `plan_issues_set`); minor →
     offer to backlog. Severity call is yours; say which and why.
   - Wave grouping (with or without flags): when tasks are independent,
     propose waves and write them with `plan_meta_set(phaseDir,
     waves: [[ids…], …])`. Waves must partition cleanly — an issue in two
     waves is a tool error.
6. Reconcile: `plan_drift()` — resolve anything flagged for this phase
   (recreate missing issues via `issue_create` + `plan_issues_set`; question
   closed-unverified ones with the user).
7. Adopt: `plan_unplanned()` — for any unplanned issue that belongs to this
   phase, add its id via `plan_issues_set` and re-phase it in the tracker
   with `issue_update(id, phase: <N>)` — phase takes the cairn phase number
   or the tracker's phase id (#142). A backend that can't re-parent says so
   via `phaseSkipped` in the result; relay that instead of assuming the
   move happened. Ask before adopting.
8. Report the plan summary and next step `/cairn:work <N>`.
