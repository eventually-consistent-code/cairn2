Execute the given phase per the `cairn-planning` skill.

**Mode check:** read `user.mode` from cairn.json (`config_get`). Absent or
`vibe` → the procedure below runs exactly as written. `engineer` → the
pairing overlay applies:

- After step 1's issue list, ask "mine or yours?" ONCE for the whole
  wave/phase — one AskUserQuestion listing the issues, the user marks
  which they're taking. Never per-issue friction.
- **cairn-claimed** issues run the unchanged lifecycle below, except the
  finished work lands as a branch/PR and does NOT merge — the close
  comment links the PR and names the human as reviewer (no-self-merge
  gate; `ship` enforces it).
- **human-claimed** issues: cairn scaffolds and steps back — create the
  branch, move the issue to in_progress with `assignee: <user.handle>`,
  and post the claim comment carrying the context: the PLAN.md task text,
  files likely touched, and (for `tdd:` issues) the failing test written
  first. Then wait — do not write further code for that issue.
- **Human says done** (or `resync`/`plan_tracker_delta` shows their
  commits landed): run the tests and the phase's verify posture against
  their work, then the standard close — close comment with evidence and
  approximate time ("logged by cairn for <handle>"),
  `issue_close(timeSpentMinutes: ...)`, ledger entry with their commit
  range. Offer `/cairn:review` on their diff — offer, not force; a
  decline is recorded in the close comment as "review declined".
- Wave ordering, TDD gates, and the failed-issue stop rule apply
  identically regardless of who holds an issue.

0. `plan_tracker_delta()` — peek. Anything in the delta → say so in one
   line ("tracker delta: 2 new, 1 edited — `/cairn:resync` to integrate")
   and continue; a non-empty delta never blocks this verb. First run:
   the tool initializes silently, don't mention it.
1. `plan_status()` → this phase's `issues` list. Empty → stop and point at
   `/cairn:plan <N>`.
2. `--wave` (only when PLAN.md has `wave_N` frontmatter — else say so and
   point at `/cairn:plan <N>`): run waves in order (`--wave N` runs just
   that wave). Each worker runs the full per-issue lifecycle below
   (claim → work → close → ledger) — the dispatch mechanism changes,
   the lifecycle never does. Wave N+1 starts only when every wave-N
   issue is closed and merged. A failed issue: let the wave's others
   finish, then STOP before the next wave and report — never build on
   possibly-broken foundations. Two dispatch paths, checked in order:

   **Primary — the harness has the `Workflow` tool** (probe #86 validated
   every leg of this path): dispatch the wave as ONE `Workflow` run.
   Script shape: `pipeline(issues, claim, work, verify, close)` — one
   `agent()` call per stage per issue, so the run graph mirrors the
   lifecycle exactly and the platform owns retries, ordering, and fan-in.
   - Every stage declares a structured-output schema and returns
     machine-readable status (issue id, stage, ok, detail) — the schema
     IS the worker contract; a misbehaving worker degrades to a
     schema-valid failure result without harming its siblings.
   - Workers reach cairn MCP tools by loading them via `ToolSearch`
     (`select:mcp__plugin_cairn_cairn__...`) — say so in every agent
     prompt; workflow subagents don't inherit loaded schemas.
   - File-mutating work stages get `opts.isolation: "worktree"` — same
     isolation rule as the fallback path, enforced by the platform.
   - `.filter(Boolean)` on collected results — the documented contract
     resolves failed thunks to `null`; keep the filter even though
     schema'd failures usually arrive as values.
   - The moment dispatch returns, record the run id in BOTH places so it
     survives /clear: `continuity_checkpoint(source: "work", notes:
     "wave <N> run <id>")` AND `outlook_emit(tracker: {open, inProgress,
     blocked, nextVerb: "work <N> --wave — resume run <id>", asOf})`.
   - Re-entry on an interrupted wave: resume with `resumeFromRunId: <id>`
     instead of redispatching — unchanged agent-call prefixes replay from
     cache, so completed workers are free and only unfinished ones run.
   After the run: any issue whose result failed (or vanished in the
   filter) → the failed-issue stop rule above.

   **Fallback — no `Workflow` tool** (other harnesses): within the wave,
   dispatch one subagent per issue IN PARALLEL — worktree isolation for
   any file-mutating issue. Each subagent runs the full per-issue
   lifecycle below (claim → work → close → ledger).
3. For each issue id, in order: `issue_get(id)` — skip closed ones. If it's
   assigned to someone who is not you (compare against `user.handle` in
   cairn.json, only when it's set there — if unset, there are no ownership
   checks), say so and skip unless the user overrides.
4. Before starting an issue: record `git rev-parse HEAD` as this issue's
   `baseCommit` and the current time as its `startedAt` (both feed the
   close in steps 6-7). Then `issue_update(id, state: "in_progress")` —
   and when `user.handle` is set in cairn.json, also pass
   `assignee: <handle>` so teammates see who holds it. Then post the
   claim comment: `issue_comment(id, ...)` — starting now, which wave and
   PLAN.md task this is, base commit as a short ref on its own line.
   Plain language throughout (leak-guard discipline, same as `trace`).
   Then `context_set(phase: <N>, issueId: id)`.
5. Do the work the issue + PLAN.md describe. Track in-session with TaskCreate;
   the tracker stays the durable truth.
   When this issue's id is in PLAN.md `tdd:` frontmatter, the work is
   RED → GREEN → REFACTOR, each its own commit: (RED) write the failing
   test, run it, show the failure, commit; (GREEN) minimal code to pass,
   run, commit; (REFACTOR) clean up, tests stay green, commit. Record the
   RED and GREEN shas — `ledger_append` takes them as `redCommit` /
   `greenCommit` at close. Skipping RED on an eligible task: stop and
   restart the task; verify fails the phase on a missing pair regardless.
   A bug surfacing mid-issue that is NOT this issue's scope routes to
   `trace` (fast lane allowed) — never an inline detour; the trace's
   tracker issue keeps the discovery visible.
   Progress comments as the work lands — real milestones only:
   RED/GREEN/REFACTOR committed, a subtask done, a blocker hit, a trace
   spun off. Several small steps batch into ONE `issue_comment`; tracker
   noise is a failure mode, not diligence. No silent state transitions,
   ever — if the tracker state changes, a comment says why.
6. On completion **with tests passing**: post the close comment first —
   `issue_comment(id, ...)`: what shipped in plain language, the commit
   range as short refs on their own line, the test evidence (suite name +
   pass count), and "time spent: ~Xm" computed from
   `startedAt`. When the cost log has rows for this issue
   (`node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/scripts/cost-report.mjs" --issue <id>`
   returns > 0), add "agent cost: ~$X (approximate)" beside the time
   line — estimate vs actual vs spend in one comment.
   Then `issue_close(id, timeSpentMinutes: <X>)` — backends
   with worklog support (`worklogLogged: true` in the result) get a real
   worklog entry; the comment line covers the rest. On stopping early:
   leave in_progress and post a parked comment — why it stopped, what
   remains.
7. On `issue_close`: `ledger_append(phaseDir: <NN-slug>, taskRef: id, summary:
   <one line — what shipped>, baseCommit: <HEAD when this issue started>,
   headCommit: <HEAD now>, issueId: id, closedDate: <today, YYYY-MM-DD>,
   redCommit: <RED sha — TDD tasks only>, greenCommit: <GREEN sha — TDD
   tasks only>)` — the durable, git-committed record that the task landed.
8. After the last issue: `context_set(issueId: null)` and suggest
   `/cairn:verify <N>`.
