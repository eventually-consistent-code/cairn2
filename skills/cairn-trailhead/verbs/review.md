Five-axis code review of a diff, branch, or phase — a fresh read against
the code as it stands, not a retro-check against old claims (that's
`audit`). Every review closes the same way: a record, then tracker issues
for anything that matters.

## Target resolution

| target | resolves to |
|---|---|
| (none) | the working diff — `git diff` plus whatever's staged |
| a branch name | the range between that branch and `main` |
| a phase number | that phase's ledgered commit ranges (read `LEDGER.md` for the phase — the base/head commits recorded there, not a guess at the range) |

No target means the working diff, full stop — don't go hunting for a
"more interesting" target when the caller didn't name one.

## The five axes

Walk the resolved diff against each axis. A clean axis is still worth a
line in the record ("no findings") — silence isn't the same as checked.

| axis | what it's looking for |
|---|---|
| correctness | logic errors, wrong edge-case handling, off-by-ones, state that can drift out of sync |
| clarity | code a future reader (or agent) will misread — misleading names, buried intent, comments that lie |
| architecture | the wrong layer doing the work, coupling that will bite the next change, reuse that got skipped |
| security | injection, auth gaps, secrets in the diff, trust boundaries crossed without a check |
| tests | claims the diff makes that nothing verifies — new behavior with no test, a test that can't actually fail |

Every finding gets ranked **critical**, **important**, or **minor**, and
every finding names a `file:line` and a concrete failure scenario — not
"this could be a problem" but the actual input or sequence that breaks it.
A finding without a scenario is a hunch, not a finding; downgrade it or cut
it before it goes in the record.

## Closing discipline — every review, no exceptions

1. For each finding rated **critical** or **important**: `issue_create`
   with label `cairn:review`, the severity as the literal first line of
   the body (`Critical: …` / `Important: …`), plain language a
   non-engineer could read cold — the scenario, not the stack trace.
2. **Minor** findings stay in the review record only. The record already
   has them; a tracker full of minors is a tracker nobody reads.
3. `audit_record(scope: "review-<target>", verdict, findings)` — every
   review ends here, clean or not. `<target>` is whatever resolved above
   (`working`, the branch name, or `<phase>`). A clean pass is still a
   finding worth recording — it's the proof the review ran.

Skipping the record because the diff looked fine is still skipping it.

## `--fix`

Only after the record exists and the critical/important issues are filed.
Same contract as `audit` — two shapes, and only two:

- **Mechanical** (the fix is obvious and small — a missing null check, a
  wrong comparison, a test that should've existed): fix it directly, one
  commit per finding, then `issue_comment` with a plain-language "what was
  wrong / what changed" note, then `issue_close`.
- **Investigation-shaped** (the fix isn't obvious, or touches more than
  the finding itself): open `trace_start` instead and hand it off — don't
  guess at a fix under review's roof.

Never an improvised inline fix for anything in between. Not clearly
mechanical means investigation-shaped by default — that's the safe side
to be wrong on.

## Mirror rules

Same discipline as `audit` and `trace`: plain language, no code blocks, no
file paths, no internal refs a non-engineer would bounce off of, on
everything that lands on the tracker. `file:line` and the failure scenario
belong in the review record, not the issue body — the record is for
engineers re-deriving the fix, the issue is for a manager triaging by
severity. The severity-first-line rule is the one place those two
audiences meet: it's the first thing both of them read.
