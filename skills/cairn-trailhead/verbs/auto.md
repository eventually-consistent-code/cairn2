Chained hands-off execution of remaining phases. OPT-IN and explicit: show
exactly what will run before anything runs.

1. `plan_status()` — the run list is every phase with CONTEXT.md and
   without VERIFICATION.md, in order. Show it (phases, issue counts) with
   ONE confirmation question. No CONTEXT.md → that phase is excluded and
   listed as skipped — auto never invents context.
2. Per phase, in order: plan if PLAN.md has no tasks (the `plan` verb's
   steps, standard depth) → the `work` verb's steps → the `verify` verb's
   steps. The A0 handoff tools track progress automatically; a killed run
   resumes via `/cairn:waypoint resume`.
3. HARD STOPS — halt the run, report, hand back: failed verify;
   `plan_drift` flags; any tracker error; any security-relevant decision
   (auth, secrets, data exposure, dependency trust).
   On a failed-verify stop, the report includes the ready-made trace
   handoff: the exact `trace_start` description + first-evidence text.
   auto never starts the trace itself — no self-repair; that is the
   user's move next session.
   Engineer mode (`user.mode: engineer`) adds one more: a completed
   cairn-authored issue whose PR awaits human review is a natural stop —
   auto never merges its own work past a human gate. The run report
   lists the waiting PRs.
4. Unattended decisions resolve against these principles, in order: prefer
   completeness over shortcuts; match existing patterns; choose reversible
   options; mirror the user's past choices; defer ambiguity (pick the
   defer-able reading, note it); escalate security (that's a hard stop,
   not a principle call). Every such decision is logged in the run report
   with the principle that resolved it.
5. Genuinely subjective taste calls (naming, UX copy, structure with no
   pattern to match) do NOT stop the run: take the reversible option, add
   it to the taste batch, present the batch as ONE review at the end.
6. End of run (or stop): report — phases completed, decisions + principles,
   taste batch, stop reason if stopped, next step.

## Batch mode — `auto --batch [--budget <tokens|$usd>] [--phases <N,N,...>]`

Bare `auto` (everything above) is UNCHANGED. `--batch` is the budgeted,
interviewed, walk-away form: stage everything up front — phase selection,
estimates, research questions, push authority — write it into a run
manifest, then hand off to headless execution. The manifest is the
executor's SOLE source of authority: a phase outside it never runs, and
never pushes.

Staging sequence, in order:

1. **Candidate set.** `--phases N,N,...` given → exactly those phases
   (each still needs CONTEXT.md, same exclusion rule as step 1 above).
   Otherwise `--budget` picks them: call `token_estimate` per remaining
   phase and fit phases into the budget on the HIGH end of each range —
   conservative on purpose, and the interview says so ("fit on worst-case
   estimates; a run that comes in under budget beats one that stops
   mid-phase"). `--budget` accepts raw tokens (`--budget 5000000`) or
   dollars (`--budget $300`). Neither flag → all remaining phases, budget
   uncapped (state that plainly too).
2. **Selection honesty.** Order/group the candidates: map present and
   fresh (`map_query` on phase dependencies) → dependency-smart grouping;
   no map, or stale → roadmap order. Either way the interview SAYS which
   one it used, in one plain line — e.g. "ordered by the project map's
   dependency edges" or "no fresh map — running in roadmap order". Never
   imply dependency intelligence that wasn't there.
3. **Research + question round.** Unplanned candidate phases get the
   `scout` verb's batch form (cross-phase pool, one dispatch). Its
   clarification questions surface HERE, at staging, while the user is
   still present — never mid-run. Answers are folded into RESEARCH.md as
   usual AND recorded in the manifest's `answers`, so the executor never
   has to ask.
4. **The staging gate — ONE AskUserQuestion.** Present, in one ask:
   - the phase list (numbers, names, issue counts, order/grouping);
   - per-phase estimate RANGES (never point claims) + the run total
     (low–high) vs the ceiling, with the fit-on-high caveat;
   - explicit push pre-authorization: "authorize pushes for THESE phases,
     for this run?" — scope-limited to the manifest's phases, recorded
     with a timestamp. This is REC-5's ship confirmation moved to run
     start, never silently bypassed:

     > Provenance: adopted from the 2026-08-12 product council (REC-5),
     > accepted by the project owner over cairn's no-action
     > recommendation. Vibe mode's silent-judgment rule explicitly does
     > NOT apply to this ask.

   Options: approve + authorize pushes / approve WITHOUT push authority /
   adjust / cancel. Declining push authority does NOT cancel the run — it
   downgrades it to verify-stop: phases run headless through work and
   verify, but nothing pushes; the report lists what's ready to ship by
   hand. "Adjust" loops back to step 1 with the user's changes.
5. **Write the run's authority.** On approval: `run_manifest(action:
   "create")` with the phases, estimates, ceiling, and staged answers;
   `run_manifest(action: "grant_push")` only if the user authorized
   pushes; then `budget_check` with the ceiling to open the spend ledger
   (hard at boundaries — no new phase/wave starts past the ceiling, an
   in-flight wave finishes; bounded overshoot ≤ one wave). Then
   `run_manifest(action: "set_status", status: "running")` and report
   "staged — run starts now."
6. **Execution.** The run starts — the sequence below consumes the
   manifest from here. Everything above this line happened with the user
   present; everything below runs without them.

### Execution sequence — the headless run

Bare auto's rules ride along unchanged: the hard stops (tracker error,
security-relevant decision, engineer-mode PR gate), the
unattended-decision principles, and the taste batch all apply inside
batch mode exactly as written in steps 3–5 above. What follows is the
batch-specific loop.

1. **Preconditions + run visibility.** Manifest status must be
   `running` (`run_manifest(action: "read")`) and the ledger open
   (`budget_check(runId)` with no phase — a read-only poll). A manifest
   reading `complete` or `stopped` is terminal: report, don't run —
   re-staging means a new runId, never a resurrected old one.
   First act: the run's umbrella tracker issue — `issue_create` (label
   `batch-run`, runId in the title), opening comment in plain language:
   the phase list as staged, the ceiling, push authority granted or
   declined. Then `continuity_checkpoint(source: "auto", notes:
   "batch run <runId> — phase <first>")` so a killed run leaves a trail.
   **Resume path — a killed run re-enters HERE.** The checkpoint notes
   hold the runId; `run_manifest(action: "read")` is the authority on
   what was approved (a resumed run never widens scope or push
   authority). "Where was I" resolves by trust order: tracker + git
   first (VERIFICATION.md present, issues closed, commits/pushes
   landed), then the ledger's boundary rows, then the handoff note.
   Manifest phases already verified/shipped by that evidence SKIP; the
   loop resumes at the first phase the evidence can't vouch for. The
   umbrella issue is found (runId search), never recreated.
2. **Per manifest phase, in manifest order:**
   - **Boundary budget check.** `budget_check(runId, phase: <N>)` —
     records the boundary row. Verdict `stop` → no new phase starts:
     `run_manifest(action: "set_status", status: "stopped")`, one
     plain-language comment on the umbrella issue AND on the stopped
     phase's open issues ("budget ceiling reached — run stopped before
     phase N started; spent ~X of ~Y"), then wrap (step 4).
   - **Plan if untasked.** PLAN.md has no tasks → the `plan` verb's
     steps, standard depth. Research already exists — staging's scout
     batch wrote RESEARCH.md and the manifest's `answers` carry the
     user's staging answers; planning consumes both, never re-asks.
   - **Work.** The `work` verb's `--wave` steps, per-issue lifecycle
     unchanged, with ONE addition: the wave's inner budget is the
     ledger's word — pass `budget_check`'s `innerBudgetSuggestion` down
     as the Workflow run's budget (the inner ceiling; this ledger stays
     the outer authority). BETWEEN waves: `budget_check(runId, phase:
     <N>, wave: <W>)` — same stop semantics: the in-flight wave
     finishes, a `stop` verdict refuses the next wave, then the same
     stopped-marking, comments, and wrap as the phase boundary.
   - **Verify.** The `verify` verb's steps; failure = auto's posture,
     unchanged: stop THIS phase, prepare the `trace_start` handoff
     (never start it), skip dependent phases, continue independent
     ones. "Dependent" = a later manifest phase whose CONTEXT.md or
     PLAN.md references this phase or its issues. No dependency data
     to consult → the conservative default: treat manifest order as a
     dependency chain and stop the whole run.
   - **Ship if authorized.** Manifest `pushAuth.granted` → the `ship`
     verb's steps, all gates intact (drift, open issues, the docs
     catch-up tier — a gate failure stops, it is never bypassed). The
     manifest pre-auth SUBSTITUTES for ship's step-5 AskUserQuestion:
     the push proceeds on the authority collected at the staging gate,
     scope-limited to the manifest's phases — REC-5's confirmation
     moved to run start, never silently skipped (record that line in
     the push summary). `pushAuth.granted: false` → the phase ends
     verified-not-pushed, recorded for the report; nothing pushes.
3. **Tracker-first visibility.** Per-issue claim/close comments already
   come from work's lifecycle — never duplicate them. ADD, on the
   umbrella issue, ONE comment per phase transition: phase N started /
   verified / shipped / stopped (with why). Small steps batch into that
   one comment — tracker noise is a failure mode, not diligence. At
   every phase boundary: `outlook_emit(tracker: {open, inProgress,
   blocked, nextVerb, asOf})` so the board tracks the run in real time
   — the final report is a summary, not the only visibility.
4. **Wrap — every exit lands here (complete or stopped).** In order:
   final `budget_check(runId, phase: "wrap")` boundary — the honest
   last spend row, overshoot included; `run_manifest(action:
   "set_status", status: "complete")` when the loop reached the
   manifest's end (even with failed/skipped phases — those are report
   lines), `"stopped"` when the run halted early (budget, dependency
   chain, hard stop); umbrella-issue closing comment: phases
   done/stopped/skipped, spend vs ceiling, the verified-not-pushed
   list, stop reason if any. Then hand off to the run report — next
   wave (#134), not this doc's job — and close continuity:
   `continuity_checkpoint(source: "auto", notes: "batch run <runId>
   ended <status> — next: <action>")` + one last `outlook_emit`.
