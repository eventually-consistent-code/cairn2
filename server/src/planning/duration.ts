// timestamps it already controls, instead of asking the agent -- whose
// numbers measured 6x-14x inflated in phase 24.5, and which has no
// introspective access to its own elapsed time to begin with.
//
// The ladder, best rung first, the rung always recorded beside the number:
//   1. claim_comment  -- the claim comment's tracker timestamp to close
//   2. observed_claim -- the moment this server moved the issue in progress
//   3. git_span       -- first author date to last committer date over the
//                        task's commits (computed at ledger append, the only
//                        place the commit range is known)
//   4. none           -- recorded as such, never guessed
//
// Every function here returns a value instead of throwing: a measurement
// that can fail a close is worse than no measurement.
