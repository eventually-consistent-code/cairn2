/**
 * Purpose: the ship-gate stamp (#251) -- what the last drift check said,
 *   and about which commit, so the run guard can refuse an agent push to
 *   the default branch that skipped it. plan_drift writes one stamp per
 *   project after every run: { head, clean, at }. `clean` is false only
 *   for what ship stops on (missing / closed-unverified issues, a stale
 *   security audit); the advisory kinds (stale-issue, stale-branch,
 *   roadmap-row) never make it dirty.
 *
 *   Lives in the per-machine cairn home beside the run manifests, keyed
 *   with the manifests' own project hash, so the hook and the server
 *   agree on the path without talking to each other.
 *
 *   Best effort, always: a stamp that can't be written leaves the gate
 *   shut (the guard treats a missing or stale stamp as "not checked"),
 *   so a write failure never fails the drift check itself.
 *
 * removeWhen: never -- "never push with flagged drift" is an owner policy,
 *   not a workaround for a model limit.
 * Author(s): John Reed
