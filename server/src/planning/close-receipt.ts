// Close receipt (#233): the bridge between the two tools that each hold half
// of a closed task's record. issue_close has the tracker facts (the estimate
// as stored, the claim and close times, the claimed minutes, the worklog
// outcome) but no commit range; ledger_append has the range but would need
// a network read to recover the tracker side. The close writes a small
// ephemeral file keyed by issue id; the append consumes it and deletes it.
//
// Two rules matter more than the mechanism, and both live here:
//   - every read and write is best-effort and NEVER throws -- instrumentation
//     that can block a close is worse than no instrumentation;
//   - a missing or unreadable receipt is reported as a named `degraded`
//     marker, never as silent nulls, so no later reader has to guess whether
//     a null means zero or unknown.
//
// removeWhen: the durable per-task outcome record lands and the close and
// the ledger append both write into it directly (ADR 0021).
