/**
 * Purpose: the seat-finding dedup engine — N seats over one target
 * collapse to ONE finding set before anything reaches the tracker (the
 * phase's hard requirement). Pure library, no tool surface: review and
 * audit are agent-side verbs, so the coordinator calls this via node
 * against dist when it needs the reference merge, and the server consumes
 * it in future pipelines — same precedent as composeBrief in brief.ts.
 * Dependency-free and deterministic on purpose: shuffled input, same
 * output, every time.

// Constants

// Two findings merge only when they sit on the same file within this many

// "same bug, seat quoted the line above/below" case without gluing
// together genuinely separate findings further apart.
export const LINE_WINDOW = 2;

// Claim similarity floor: normalized-token Jaccard overlap
// (|intersection| / |union|) must reach this for two claims to count as
// the same finding. 0.5 means the claims share at least as many tokens
// as they differ by — paraphrases of one bug clear it, distinct claims
// about the same location don't. Exact normalized match short-circuits.

// Main

/**
 * Collapses N seats' findings over one target into one finding set.
 *
 * Merge rule (documented here, tested in test/dedup.test.ts): two
 * findings merge when they name the SAME file, sit within LINE_WINDOW
 * (±2) lines of the cluster's anchor — its lowest-line member — and
 * their claims match: exact normalized text, or normalized-token Jaccard
 * overlap at or above CLAIM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD (0.5) — OR, when both
 * supplied a failure_scenario, their scenarios match by the same rule
 * (same failure, different headline). Distinct claims with distinct (or
 * absent) scenarios at the same location stay separate findings.
 *
 * A merged finding credits every raising seat (`seats`, sorted by name,
 * one entry per seat with that seat's own score attributed), keeps the
 * HIGHEST severity any seat assigned, anchors at the lowest merged line,
 * and carries the claim of the highest-severity raising finding.
 *
 * Deterministic: input is sorted (file, line, severity, seat, claim)
 * before clustering, so shuffled input yields byte-identical output.
 * Output order is (file, line, severity, claim).
 *
 * :param findings: raw per-seat findings, any order
 * :returns: the deduplicated finding set, deterministically ordered
