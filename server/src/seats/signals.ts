/**
 * Purpose: signal→seat dispatch — derives normalized scope signals from a
 * diff summary, selects which roster seats fire under the dispatch dial,
 * and resolves the model a seat's work routes to. Pure over its inputs
 * (no I/O): the caller loads the roster and yield stats and passes them
 * in. The model-routing blast-radius rule ALWAYS beats a seat's model
 * preference — encoded here, not left to verb prose.

// Constants — the STANDARD signal vocabulary
//
// deriveSignals emits ONLY these names. Seat definitions keep a free
// vocabulary (schema-side), so a project seat may declare custom signals —
// but nothing derives them this iteration, so an unmatched custom signal
// simply never fires (the seat is gated in auto dial unless another of its
// signals matches, or it declares no signals at all). Custom derivation is
// a future maturity, not built here.
//
// Path-derived (a signal fires when ANY changed path matches its pattern;
// paths are matched lowercased):
//   touches-auth    — auth-shaped names anywhere in a path (auth, login,
//                     oauth, sso, credential, password, secret, session,
//                     token, perm...). Deliberately over-broad substring
//                     match: a false fire costs one extra seat pass, a
//                     false silence costs a missed security read.
//   touches-server  — code-shaped path segments: server, src, api,
//                     backend, services. Named for the common case; the
//                     matcher covers where application code usually lives.
//   touches-docs    — .md/.mdx files, or a docs/doc path segment
//   touches-tests   — test/tests/__tests__/spec segments, or filenames
//                     with a .test. / .spec. / _test. infix
//   touches-config  — .json/.yaml/.yml/.toml/.ini files, *.config.* files,
//                     or .env* basenames
//   touches-ci      — .github/workflows, .gitlab-ci*, .circleci,
//                     azure-pipelines*, Jenkinsfile, or a ci segment
//   touches-scripts — scripts/bin/hooks segments, or .sh files
//
// Size-derived (insertions + deletions, strict bounds — a mid-size diff
// between the two emits neither):
//   diff-small — total < DIFF_SMALL_MAX (50) changed lines
//   diff-large — total > DIFF_LARGE_MIN (500) changed lines
