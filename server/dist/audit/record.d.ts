/**
 * Purpose: the audit record writer — the single place a review/audit pass
 * lands its findings (.cairn/audit/<scope>-<date>.md). Since phase 21 it
 * is also where a finding is JUDGED: every finding carries a typed
 * failure_scenario, critical/important findings carry a refutation panel
 * whose quorum is computed here (never model-asserted), REFUTED findings
 * stay in the record but never reach the tracker, and survivors credit
 * the raising seats' yield. The record is stamped with the commit it
 * judged. Since #215 a `sweep-<YYYY-MM-DD>` scope is a sweep MANIFEST:
 * it carries the cairn version, a leg index, and a delta against the
 * previous manifest (new / persisting / fixed / regressed) — computed
 * here, in the writer, never by a reader tool. parseAuditRecord reads any
 * record back.
 *
 * removeWhen: verifier votes reliably agree with human triage across a
 *   milestone, so the server-computed quorum can become advisory.
