/**
 * The observation buffer's own state (#173). The PostToolUse hook appends a
 * row per Edit/Write/Bash call to `.cairn/observations/observations.jsonl`
 * and retro is the only reader — so when retro never runs, the buffer grows
 * silently until the hook's retention guard quietly drops the oldest half.
 * Work that was never reviewed disappears without anyone being told.
 *
 * This module is the announcement: a count and an oldest-entry age that
 * `mem_stats` reports and the recall banner escalates into "run retro".
 * Capture stays passive and review stays retro-gated — nothing here reads a
 * row's contents, promotes anything to memory, or truncates the file.
 *
 * Deliberately independent of the FTS index, for the same reason the card
 * audit is (see audit.ts): the index needs a compiled native binding that
 * can be missing, and a backlog warning that dies exactly when memory is
 * unhealthy is the wrong shape. Everything here reads one plain file.
