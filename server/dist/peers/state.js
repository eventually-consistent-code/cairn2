/**
 * Purpose: the convergence memory for a peers run — a per-run store under
 * .cairn/peers/<slug>/ that survives interruption. state.json is the index
 * (meta, which peer answered which round, findings with verdicts); the raw
 * peer outputs live in per-peer files beside it and are never re-read into
 * state. An interrupted run resumes from runStatus's report of what's
 * missing, and runClose is where audit provenance comes from — assembled
 * from the RECORDS, not from whatever the interrupted conversation
 * remembered.
