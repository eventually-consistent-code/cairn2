/**
 * Purpose: allow-listed external-CLI adapters (codex/opencode/antigravity/
 * grok) — runs each as a fixed-argv child process with a hard cap on input
 * size and a timeout, CONTAINED by default: the child runs from a fresh
 * scratch dir under the OS tmpdir with the capped input staged beside it
 * as packet.txt, so the screened packet is all a peer can see (#74).
 * cwdMode "project" is the explicit escape hatch back to the project-dir
 * cwd (#56) for callers that NEED repo access. Never exec, never
 * shell interpolation — argv is always one of the four fixed templates
 * below plus (for argv-mode peers) the capped input as the single final
 * element; stdin-mode peers get input piped instead, per each CLI's
 * verified prompt convention. A peer's non-zero exit is a result, not an
 * error: peers are advisory, and the caller (the `peers` verb) is the one
 * that judges what they say. Missing binaries and disabled providers
 * degrade to PRECONDITION_FAILED — nothing here assumes a peer CLI is
 * actually installed.
