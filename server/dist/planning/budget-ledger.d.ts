/**
 * Purpose: the spend ledger for headless batch runs (#131) — the OUTER,
 *   cross-phase budget ceiling. At every phase/wave boundary the executor
 *   re-reads actual spend from the metrics jsonl the Stop hook writes and
 *   asks checkBudget() whether the NEXT unit of work may start. Verdict is
 *   "stop" the moment spent >= ceiling: no new phase/wave ever starts past
 *   the ceiling, in-flight work finishes — the documented guarantee is
 *   bounded overshoot <= one wave.
 *
 *   Metrics rows are CUMULATIVE per session: correct totals take the LATEST
 *   row per session_id (never the sum of all rows). Sessions that began
 *   after the run opened count in full; sessions that already existed at
 *   run-open (the DRIVING session — its cumulative row predates the run)
 *   count as the DELTA past a baseline snapshot taken at openRunLedger,
 *   floored at 0 (#143 — before the baseline, the driver's spend read zero
 *   all run). Wave subagents write no metrics rows at all, so the executor
 *   reports each wave's agent token total through recordBoundary's
 *   agentTokens — those accumulate as their own spend component. Spend
 *   numbers are approximate list-price estimates, same caveat as
 *   cost-report.mjs.
 *
 *   TOKEN UNIT (#152): the token component counts input + output tokens
 *   ONLY — the exact unit token-estimate.ts publishes, so a ceiling staged
 *   from an estimate range is judged in the same currency it was quoted in.
 *   Cache write/read traffic is EXCLUDED from the token count and lives in
 *   the USD component instead (est_cost_usd already prices it), because a
 *   cache-heavy driving session meters tens of millions of cache-read
 *   tokens against pennies of real cost. Baselines and deltas are computed
 *   on this same unit.
 *
 *   The Claude Code Workflow primitive exposes its own budget global in
 *   workflow scripts (budget.total / budget.spent() / budget.remaining();
 *   over-budget agent() calls THROW). That is the INNER, in-run ceiling —
 *   the executor passes checkBudget().innerBudgetSuggestion down as the
 *   invoking run's budget (#133 wires it); this ledger stays the outer
 *   authority across phases.
