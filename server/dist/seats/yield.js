/**
 * Purpose: the per-seat yield store — dispatch that prunes itself with
 * evidence. One versioned JSON file per project under ~/.cairn/yield/
 * (outside the repo, budget-ledger's conventions: injectable base dir,
 * per-machine path hashing, atomic tmp+rename writes, zod-validated
 * versioned schema). Per seat it counts dispatched / findingsRaised /
 * findingsSurvived; selection (signals.ts) consults these ONLY in auto
 * dial and gates a seat whose evidence says it isn't earning its pass.
 *
 * Posture on corruption: yield stats are advisory EVIDENCE, not config —
 * a corrupt file loads as a fresh empty state with a note, never a throw
 * (missing evidence means no pruning; it must never break a review).
 * That's a deliberate divergence from budget-ledger, where a corrupt
 * ledger guards real money and fails loud.
 * Author(s): John Reed
