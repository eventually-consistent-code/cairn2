/**
 * Purpose: wave-brief composition — `work`'s per-issue dispatch briefs,
 * composed from templates/wave-brief.md plus an optional roster seat
 * (and that seat's role-scoped memory cards) instead of freehand
 * retyping. Same {{slot}} mechanism as the peers
 * templates: every occurrence of a provided slot is replaced, and the
 * seat framing rides at the seat's declared dose. No tool surface — the
 * work verb reads the template + seat_roster directly; this module is
 * the tested reference composition (and the future server-side path).

 * Composes one wave dispatch brief from templates/wave-brief.md.

 * Seatless composition fills the framing slot empty — the generic brief,
 * structurally identical to the hand-written ones this replaces. With a
 * seat, the framing section leads, quoting lens/categories/honesty at
 * the seat's dose. An unprovided optional slot renders empty (never a
 * dangling {{marker}}); blank-line runs left by empty slots collapse,
 * and a trailing run is trimmed — the standing rules land last, so an
 * empty {{rules}} must not leave the brief ending in whitespace.
 *
 * Section order is the template's, not this function's: static framing
 * first (the cacheable prefix), then issue and plan, then the dated
 * seat memory, and the invariants last at the attention peak. Both files
 * move together or the composed brief and the template disagree.
 *
 * :param input: seat (optional), issue content, plan excerpt, rules
 * :returns: the filled brief text, ready to hand a wave worker
 * :raises CairnError: code NOT_FOUND when the template file is missing
