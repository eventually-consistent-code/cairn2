/**
 * Purpose: signal→seat dispatch — derives normalized scope signals from a
 * diff summary, selects which roster seats fire under the dispatch dial,
 * and resolves the model a seat's work routes to. Pure over its inputs
 * (no I/O): the caller loads the roster and yield stats and passes them
 * in. The model-routing blast-radius rule ALWAYS beats a seat's model
 * preference — encoded here, not left to verb prose.
