/**
 * Purpose: PostToolUse hook -- after an Edit/Write/Bash tool call, refresh the
 *   project's ~/.cairn/handoff/*.json breadcrumb (created, source,
 *   uncommitted_files) so a crash still leaves a recent handoff behind.
 *   Throttled to at most one write per 60s via the handoff file's own mtime,
 *   since PostToolUse can fire many times a minute. Fire-and-forget: any
 *   error, or no handoff to patch, is a silent no-op -- a hook must never be
 *   visible to the user or block their session.
 * Author(s): John Reed
