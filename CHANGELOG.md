# Changelog

## v2 — Confluence documentation connector (2026-07-24)

- Docs connector SPI: normalized `DocsConnector` interface, capability
  flags, registry with per-connector validation, and an optional docs
  config block — pluggable for future Notion / GitBook / Slite / SharePoint
  adapters.
- Confluence adapter: Cloud v2 REST client, Atlassian token auth,
  body-cursor pagination, and a dependency-free markdown → storage-format
  converter that degrades gracefully.
- Publishing: README becomes the project landing page inside a
  folder named for the project; the docs tree becomes child pages with
  generated contents sections; re-publish updates in place (identity =
  title + ancestry, space-wide title conflicts auto-disambiguated).
- Surface: `docs_publish` / `docs_status` server tools and the `docs` verb
  (65 tools, 37 verbs); config writes rebuild connectors without restart.
- Testing: shared docs-connector behavioral contract, in-memory fake
  enforcing production constraints, in-process tool tests, env-gated live
  suite — 555 passing tests.
- Fixes from live dogfooding: unbalanced list markup on multi-level indent
  jumps; space-wide title-collision handling. Also fixed: tracker
  connections now rebuild after config edits instead of holding stale
  backends.

## v1 — Marketing launch (2026-07-24)

- Projects section on eventually-consistent.io with cairn overview,
  competitive positioning, and quick-start pages; repository made public.
