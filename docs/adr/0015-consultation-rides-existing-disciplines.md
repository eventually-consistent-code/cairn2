# 0015 — Consultation and challenge ride existing disciplines, growing nothing

Date: 2026-09-13. Status: accepted.

## Context

Making viewpoints consultable invites surface growth in every
direction: a consult verb, a consultation tool, a challenge gate, a
new findings path to the tracker. Each would be a second way to do
something the system already does once.

## Decision

Zero new verbs, zero new tools. Consultation is a flag on review; the
challenge round is a flag on plan (deep depth includes it); the
freeform router recognizes "ask the security seat about X" and
dispatches to the review flag. Consultation output is conversational
first — only findings clearing the severity bar enter the tracker,
and they enter through the SAME closing discipline and deduplication
the review panel uses. The challenge round is advisory by
construction: its output is proposed amendments in one batched
question, never a gate a plan must pass. Brief composition, roster
resolution, and memory recall all reuse surfaces that already existed;
the one server change is an optional input on the existing brief
composer, pinned byte-identical when absent.

## Consequences

- The tool surface held flat across the entire phase — param and flag
  additions only.
- There is exactly one path from any seat's finding to the tracker,
  so the mirrors-everything principle survives consultation.
- Users learn no new verbs: asking, challenging, and reviewing are
  inflections of verbs they already know.
