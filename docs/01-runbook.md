# cairn Runbook — the complete operating manual

Ever wonder what it would take to run a real engineering workflow — planning,
tracking, memory, review, shipping — without the workflow itself becoming the
job? That's the question cairn exists to answer. This runbook is the full
operating manual: every verb, every flag, every gate, every config key, and
every error code, written so you can run any workflow end to end without
reading source.

---

## 1. Orientation

Cairn is a Claude Code plugin backed by a TypeScript MCP server. The plugin
layer (commands, skills, hooks) owns *policy and judgment*; the server owns
every mechanism with a wrong answer — state transitions, tracker mirroring,
drift math, staleness checks. You talk to it through 37 `/cairn:<verb>`
commands, all generated from one routing table.

### The three truths

Everything in cairn hangs off a simple division of authority. Learn it once
and the rest of the system makes sense:

| Truth | Lives in | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Work truth** | Your external tracker (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Asana, Azure Boards, ClickUp) | Issues, states, assignees, milestones — the single source of truth for *work items* |
| **Prose truth** | Git, inside your repo | Plans, phase context, verification records, memory cards, session files — everything written down |
| **Disposable cache** | `~/.cairn/` on your machine | The full-text memory index, the session handoff, the recall banner — rebuildable, never git-tracked, safe to delete |

On conflict, git plan docs (CONTEXT.md, PLAN.md) win over tracker issue text —
cairn updates the issue rather than silently following it. One exception:
a tracker edit detected by the delta cursor is provenance-known *newer* human
intent, and integrates forward into the plan (unless it collides with a locked
decision, which stops for you).

### Shared rules every verb inherits

- **Errors surface, never stack-trace.** Server tools fail with typed codes
  (section 11); the verb reports the code and your next action. One backend
  being down never blocks git-side operations.
- **Batch questions.** Related questions arrive as one question set, never
  one checkbox at a time.
- **Active context.** Verbs operate on the active project/phase/issue unless
  arguments override; verbs that change focus record it.
- **Continuity.** State-changing verbs refresh the session handoff
  automatically; `ship` and `summit` clear it.
- **Decision surfacing (engineer mode).** With `user.mode: engineer`, a
  genuine design fork — multiple defensible shapes with real trade-offs —
  stops and asks you, cairn's recommendation first. The bar is "would a peer
  have wanted a say," not "is this a decision." Vibe mode (the default)
  resolves judgment calls silently.
- Every verb reads `.cairn/profile.md` when present and calibrates tone and
  depth to it — advisory only, never a change to what a verb decides.

## 2. The core lifecycle

The spine of cairn is six verbs: `new → plan → work → verify → ship →
summit`. Everything else supports this loop.

### `/cairn:new [project name]`

Start here. From an empty repo to a routed plan in one verb.

1. Confirms `cairn.json` exists (if not, it points you at
   `templates/cairn.json.example` and stops).
2. A brief interview: vision, 3–10 requirements, phase breakdown. It also
   asks your collaboration mode once (skipped if `cairn.json` already sets
   `user.mode`): **vibe** — cairn drives end-to-end (default) — or
   **engineer** — you claim issues, write code, and make the design calls
   while cairn pairs, verifies, and keeps the tracker honest. Choosing
   engineer collects your tracker handle too, and sets both in one config
   patch.
3. Scaffolds `.cairn/plans/PROJECT.md` (vision + requirements) and
   `roadmap.md` (the phase table).
4. For each phase: creates the phase directory and ensures the tracker has a
   matching phase object (milestone, epic, or list, depending on backend).
5. For each requirement: creates a tracker issue and records the ids in the
   phase's PLAN.md frontmatter.
6. Reports what was created and points at `/cairn:plan 1`.

Have an existing codebase with tracker history instead? That's
`/cairn:import`.

### `/cairn:plan <N> [flags]`

Plan a phase. Depth resolves in this order: command flag > PLAN.md `depth:`
frontmatter > `cairn.json` default > `standard`.

| Depth | Research | Plan | Verify posture later |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--quick` | none | draft tasks directly | tests pass |
| standard | one research subagent for unknowns | PLAN.md + CONTEXT.md | + tracker cross-check (drift) |
| `--deep` | parallel fan-out, multi-angle | + a plan-checker agent pass | + adversarial verification |

Steps: it first peeks at the tracker delta (new/edited issues since last
sync — mentioned in one line, never blocking), confirms the phase directory
exists, researches per depth, writes the task breakdown into PLAN.md (locked
decisions go in CONTEXT.md), reconciles drift, and offers to adopt any
unplanned tracker issues that belong to this phase (always asking first).

The flags, all combinable:

- `--mvp` — shape the first tasks as ONE thin vertical slice exercising every
  layer end to end (a walking skeleton). Depth and breadth come only after
  the slice stands. A slice that can't demo is not a slice.
- `--tdd` — per task, judge TDD eligibility (behavior-testable code — logic,
  APIs, parsers, state machines — yes; config, docs, scaffolding, styling,
  generated code — no). The proposed split arrives as ONE question for your
  overrides, then lands in PLAN.md `tdd:` frontmatter. Enforcement happens at
  work time (RED/GREEN commit pairs) and verify time (the ledger check).
- `--prd <file>` — read the product requirements doc first; interview ONLY
  the gaps it leaves, batched into one question.
- `--ingest <glob>` — read matching docs; write their decisions into
  CONTEXT.md as locked decisions with source links. Conflicting docs surface
  the conflict — never a silent pick.
- `--gaps` — read this phase's verification failures and the latest resync
  report; propose new or amended tasks. Goal-breaking gaps become issues in
  this phase now; minor ones get offered to the backlog.
- `--model <auto|haiku|sonnet|opus>` — override the agent model routing for
  this run (see the routing rubric under section 8).
- Wave grouping (with or without flags): when tasks are independent, cairn
  proposes waves and records them in PLAN.md frontmatter. Waves must
  partition cleanly — an issue in two waves is a tool error.

All task-list changes flow through validated server tools, never hand-edits
of frontmatter — that's how validation stays honest.

### `/cairn:work <N> [--wave [N]]`

Execute the phase. The per-issue lifecycle, in vibe mode:

1. Tracker-delta peek (one line, non-blocking), then read the phase's issue
   list. Empty list → stop and point at `/cairn:plan <N>`.
2. For each issue in order: fetch it, skip closed ones. If it's assigned to
   someone who isn't you (checked against `user.handle` when set), say so and
   skip unless you override.
3. Before starting: record the current commit as the issue's base and the
   time as its start. Move the issue to `in_progress` (with your handle as
   assignee when configured) and post a claim comment — starting now, which
   wave and task, base commit as a short ref. Then set the active context.
4. Do the work. Progress comments land at real milestones only — a subtask
   done, a blocker hit, a trace spun off; several small steps batch into one
   comment. Tracker noise is a failure mode, not diligence. No silent state
   transitions, ever — if the tracker state changes, a comment says why.
5. **TDD tasks** (ids in PLAN.md `tdd:` frontmatter) run RED → GREEN →
   REFACTOR, each its own commit: write the failing test, run it, show the
   failure, commit (RED); minimal code to pass, commit (GREEN); clean up with
   tests green, commit (REFACTOR). The RED and GREEN shas go into the ledger
   at close. Skipping RED on an eligible task means stop and restart —
   verify fails the phase on a missing pair regardless.
6. **A bug surfacing mid-issue that is not this issue's scope routes to
   `trace`** — never an inline detour. The trace's tracker issue keeps the
   discovery visible.
7. On completion with tests passing: close comment first (what shipped in
   plain language, commit range, test evidence, approximate time spent), then
   close the issue — backends with worklog support get a real worklog entry.
   Stopping early: leave it in progress with a parked comment (why, what
   remains).
8. Every close appends a line to the phase's git-committed `LEDGER.md` — the
   durable record that the task landed, with base/head commits and (for TDD
   tasks) the RED/GREEN pair.
9. After the last issue: clear the issue context and suggest
   `/cairn:verify <N>`.

`--wave` (only when PLAN.md has wave frontmatter): waves run in order;
`--wave N` runs just that wave. Within a wave, one subagent per issue runs in
parallel, with worktree isolation for anything file-mutating. Wave N+1 starts
only when every wave-N issue is closed and merged. A failed issue: the wave's
others finish, then the run STOPS before the next wave — never build on
possibly-broken foundations.

**Engineer mode overlay** (`user.mode: engineer`): after the issue list, one
"mine or yours?" question for the whole wave/phase. Cairn-claimed issues run
the normal lifecycle except the work lands as a branch/PR that does NOT
merge — the close comment links the PR and names you as reviewer.
Human-claimed issues: cairn scaffolds (branch, in-progress state, a claim
comment carrying the task text, likely files, and for TDD issues the failing
test written first) and then steps back. When you say done (or your commits
show up in resync), cairn runs the tests and verify posture against your
work, closes with evidence and time logged on your behalf, and *offers*
`/cairn:review` — a decline is recorded, not overridden.

### `/cairn:verify <N>`

Goal-backward verification — the phase must deliver what it *promised*, not
merely have its tasks closed.

1. Re-read the phase's CONTEXT.md and PLAN.md; check the codebase against the
   promise. Run the test suite. Deep depth adds an adversarial verification
   subagent.
2. Drift check — this phase must contribute nothing flagged.
3. Open-issue check — the phase's tracker issue list must be empty of open
   issues; stragglers get reported, never closed unexamined.
4. TDD evidence — every id in PLAN.md `tdd:` frontmatter must have a ledger
   line carrying a `tdd <red>..<green>` segment. Any missing pair → the phase
   FAILS, and no VERIFICATION.md is written.
5. On pass: write the phase's `VERIFICATION.md` — what was checked, what
   passed, deviations. **Its existence is the machine-read signal that the
   phase is verified** — drift treats closed issues in verified phases as
   normal from then on.
6. **A failed verification routes to `trace` — mandatory.** Open a trace with
   the failure as the description, log the failing output as the first
   evidence entry, and continue there. Never patch-and-rerun inline.
   Proven-obvious ≤3-line causes may use trace's fast lane — still traced,
   still mirrored.

Failure honesty is policy: never write VERIFICATION.md for a phase that
didn't pass. A failed verify is a failed verify.

### `/cairn:ship`

The pre-push gate:

1. Drift check — anything flagged: stop and report. Do not push.
2. Every phase with a VERIFICATION.md must show all its issues closed
   (spot-checked live) — any still open: stop.
3. Engineer mode only: no cairn-authored PR may still be awaiting human
   review. Human review is the merge gate; ship never overrides it.
4. Clean gate → commit outstanding plan-doc changes, push the branch, clear
   the session handoff (shipping ends the session), and offer a PR if the
   project uses them.

Never pushes with flagged drift or open issues on a verified phase. That's
the whole point of the gate.

### `/cairn:summit`

Complete the milestone. The server gates hard — nothing archives until every
phase is verified.

1. Show what's completing: phases, verification state, the native tracker
   milestone when the backend has one. Any unverified phase → stop, list
   them, point at `/cairn:verify <N>`.
2. One batched question: the milestone summary (1–3 sentences), whether to
   start the next milestone, and — if no native milestone exists yet —
   whether to create one now.
3. Complete the milestone: closes tracker phases (recording skips for
   backends whose phase primitive can't close), releases the native milestone
   when supported, archives `phases/` to `milestones/vN/`, bumps the roadmap.
   On `PRECONDITION_FAILED` or `TRACKER_DOWN`: report and stop — re-running
   after a fix is safe; the operation is idempotent.
4. Git side (always agent-side — the server never writes git): commit the
   archive and tag `v<N>`.
5. Clear the handoff — the milestone is done; no session survives it.
6. If you said yes to the next milestone: create it, interview goals and
   first phases (batched), scaffold, add roadmap rows.

## 3. Every verb, A to Z (grouped)

Each verb below: purpose, exact args, when to reach for it, what happens
under the hood, and the gotchas. The core six are detailed in section 2;
they're summarized here for completeness.

### Lifecycle

**`new [project name]`** — new project: interview, plan artifacts, tracker
mirror, issues. See section 2. Gotcha: it refuses to run without
`cairn.json` — config first, always.

**`plan <N> [--quick|--deep] [--model <m>] [--tdd] [--mvp] [--prd <file>]
[--ingest <glob>] [--gaps]`** — plan a phase per the depth dial. See
section 2. Gotcha: a non-empty tracker delta gets one line of mention and
never blocks planning; `/cairn:resync` is the integration path.

**`work <N> [--wave [N]]`** — execute a phase. See section 2. Gotchas:
`--wave` requires wave frontmatter (plan first); ownership checks only exist
when `user.handle` is set; the mid-issue-bug rule is absolute — route to
`trace`, don't detour.

**`verify <N>`** — goal-backward phase check. See section 2. Gotcha:
VERIFICATION.md's *existence* is the verified signal, so it is never written
on a failure — and a failed verify mandatorily opens a trace.

**`ship`** — gate on drift-clean + no open issues in verified phases, then
push. See section 2.

**`summit`** — complete the milestone: verify gate, tracker close/release,
archive, tag. See section 2. Gotcha: safe to re-run after a partial tracker
failure — the completion is idempotent.

**`status [--stats]`** — the one-screen view. Peeks the tracker delta, then
renders: the phase table (artifacts present as C/R/P/V, issue counts), the
active phase's issues (id · title · state · assignee), drift flags each with
a one-line remedy, unplanned tracker issues with an adoption offer, open
backlog/seed marks (seeds get flagged when their trigger reads as met —
firing is cairn's judgment to surface, yours to act on), open traces, open
sessions by kind, and open audit/review findings. Ends with the obvious next
step. `--stats` folds in live-read project statistics — phase counts, issue
counts grouped by label, memory index size, session counts, audit-record
counts. Every number is a live read at that moment, never a cached snapshot;
that's the entire reason stats live inside `status` instead of a report file.

**`auto`** — chained hands-off execution of remaining phases. Opt-in and
explicit: the run list (every phase with CONTEXT.md and without
VERIFICATION.md, in order) is shown with ONE confirmation before anything
runs. Phases without CONTEXT.md are excluded and listed as skipped — auto
never invents context. Per phase: plan if needed (standard depth) → work →
verify. Hard stops that halt the run and hand back: a failed verify (the
report includes a ready-made trace handoff — auto never starts the trace
itself; no self-repair), drift flags, any tracker error, any
security-relevant decision (auth, secrets, data exposure, dependency trust),
and — engineer mode — a cairn-authored PR awaiting human review. Unattended
decisions resolve against ordered principles (completeness over shortcuts,
match existing patterns, choose reversible, mirror your past choices, defer
ambiguity, escalate security) and every one is logged with the principle that
resolved it. Genuinely subjective taste calls don't stop the run — the
reversible option is taken and the batch is presented as ONE review at the
end. A killed run resumes via `/cairn:waypoint resume`.

**`fast "<change>"`** — trivial inline change: one issue, ≤3 files, one
atomic commit. Guardrail first: if the change plausibly touches more than 3
files or needs design judgment, it stops and suggests `/cairn:plan` before
creating anything. Otherwise: create the issue (label `fast`), make the
change (growing past 3 files mid-flight: stop, leave the issue open with a
note), pass the relevant tests, one conventional commit, close with the sha
in the note. No ledger entry — there's no phase. Full paper trail: claim,
close (with approximate time), or parked comments, leak-guard discipline
throughout.

### Planning aids

**`scout <N>`** — research a phase WITHOUT planning it: `plan`'s research
stage alone, resumable. RESEARCH.md sections carry `<!-- scout: done -->` or
`<!-- scout: pending -->` markers; done sections are never re-researched (no
marker = legacy content, treated as done). Topics come from CONTEXT.md
unknowns and PLAN.md gaps; each section's marker flips to done as it
completes, so a kill mid-run loses at most one section. The finished brief is
indexed into memory. Use it when you want the knowledge now and the plan
later.

**`route insert|remove|edit <N> ["name"]`** — roadmap surgery. Never
renumbers existing phases — decimal insertion only (renumbering is where
prior tools broke). `insert <N.5> "name"` scaffolds a decimal-numbered phase
between its neighbors. `remove <N>` shows what dies first (open issues,
artifacts), asks one batched confirm-plus-per-issue-close-or-reassign
question, closes the tracker phase object when the backend supports closing
it (otherwise annotates the name and says so), moves the phase directory to
the removed archive, and strikes the roadmap row. `edit <N> "new name"`
renames the phase directory slug, roadmap row, doc headings, and tracker
phase name; scope changes are locked-decision edits recorded with what
changed and why.

**`import <phase url, id, or name>`** — reverse-mirror tracker-origin work
into cairn. Resolves the reference (URL → the identifying segment for your
backend; id/name pass through), scaffolds project and phase docs, writes the
phase's issue ids into PLAN.md frontmatter. An ambiguous name errors with
candidates — re-run with the exact id. Then the gap interview: the tracker
says *what*; you supply *why* — vision into PROJECT.md, locked decisions into
CONTEXT.md. Use it when the work already exists in the tracker and cairn is
arriving late to the party.

**`resync`** — both directions of drift in one verb. Git side: detect
commits no ledger range covers (first run just initializes the marker),
group them by likely phase with reasoning shown, and refresh CONTEXT.md/
PLAN.md per affected phase (assumptions broken outright → offer
`/cairn:plan <N> --gaps`). Tracker side: read the delta cursor — new phases
route to `import`, new issues get folded into their best-fit phase (with
reasoning; no confident fit → you choose), edited issues integrate forward
(cursor-detected edits are provenance-known newer human intent and win —
except an edit colliding with a locked decision, which stops for you), state
changes get their remedy (externally closed-unverified → verify or reopen),
and declined items get labeled `cairn:backlog` plus a reconcile comment so
the editor sees why the plan didn't follow. Only after the adoption questions
are answered does the cursor advance — un-acked deltas re-surface every scan.

**`probe "<question>" | (none = frontier) | --wrap [<id>]`** — risk-ordered
throwaway spike sessions. With a question: opens a `cairn:spike` issue and a
session file, then runs the experiment loop HIGHEST-UNCERTAINTY FIRST — the
question most likely to kill the whole approach gets tested before anything
that only refines it. Each cycle: state what the experiment validates
*before* running it, build it in the probe's throwaway directory (prefer
something you can FEEL working over a stdout dump), log what actually
happened ("it worked" is not a result — the surprises are the result),
capture any preference or constraint you state mid-loop as a requirement
entry (losing one means re-discovering it the expensive way later), and log a
verdict: VALIDATED | INVALIDATED | PARTIAL, with the why. Close archives the
session with a `proceed|pivot|stop` resolution. No args = frontier mode:
the session landscape (a tool, the only source of truth — never
reconstructed from memory) plus the roadmap proposes risk-ordered candidates,
splitting integration risk from frontier risk; a settled `stop` resolution is
NEVER re-proposed. `--wrap [<id>]` promotes a resolved probe into a durable
project skill with provenance, then *offers* to delete the throwaway
directory — never auto-deletes. There is deliberately no fast lane: if the
answer is already obvious, that's a `mark`, not a spike.

**`draft "<design question>" | (none = frontier) | --wrap [<id>]`** —
multi-variant design sketches on a shared theme. Every variant in every
session links the same `themes/default.css` — CSS custom properties ONLY
(colors, type scale, spacing, radii); no component styles, no layout, ever —
so a picked direction reads as one system, not three unrelated pages.
Alongside it, `tokens.json` mirrors the same properties as typed groups;
every token change touches BOTH files in the same change — a token in one
and not the other is drift `audit ui` will flag. The loop: one design
question per variant set (never "pick a color AND a layout" — you can't
evaluate two axes at once), one self-contained HTML file per option, a
decision logged when you pick — and decisions COMPOUND: later variants honor
them, never re-litigate. Passing remarks that matter get note entries. Close
archives with the chosen direction as the resolution. Frontier mode proposes
consistency sketches (screens drifted from a locked decision) and frontier
sketches (undesigned areas); settled rejections are never re-proposed.
`--wrap` promotes a resolved session to a skill, same as probe. Non-trivial
questions dispatch to the `cairn-designer` agent — the verb keeps the
session lifecycle and tracker mirror; the agent does the wireframe → tokens
→ prototype work. No fast lane, by design.

### Capture & memory

**`mark "<text>" [--seed "<trigger>"] [--note]`** — zero-friction capture in
ONE tool call. No questions, ever — structure happens at pickup, not
capture. Default: a tracker issue labeled `cairn:backlog`; the id is echoed
and you're done. `--seed "<trigger>"`: a `cairn:seed` issue whose body
records the trigger; `status` lists open seeds and flags any whose trigger
reads as met. `--note`: a memory `note` card scoped to the active
phase/issue — knowledge, not work; it never becomes tracker noise. Pickup
paths: backlog marks get adopted by `plan` or triaged later; notes surface
through `recall` and the session banner.

**`remember "<fact>" [--type decision|constraint|gotcha|reference]`** —
store durable knowledge. One durable fact → a memory card (with scope from
the active context and provenance — the files and commits the fact is about
— when known); bulk material (tool output, fetched docs, research dumps) →
the disposable index instead. Cards are git-committed — they ship with the
repo, and cairn reminds you of that.

**`recall "<query>" [--phase N] [--issue <id>]`** — search memory, scoped
tight by default (flags > active context > whole project). Durable cards
come back first with staleness surfaced — `STALE`/changed/deleted cards are
reported with what moved and re-verified, never silently trusted — then
index matches, matched sections only, never raw bulk. Every item cites its
source and scope.

**`retro [<N> | --milestone]`** — write the lessons a future session needs.
Default scope: the last verified phase; `--milestone` spans every phase of
the current milestone including just-archived ones. Evidence comes from the
ledger, verification records, git log over the ledger ranges, and closed
issues. Lessons become cards typed decision/constraint/gotcha with
provenance from the ledger range and honest confidence: `high` = verified by
this scope's events, `medium` = plausible inference, `low` = hunch worth
recording. Prior cards in scope get re-graded: confirmed → confidence up one
step; contradicted → down to `low` plus a corrected NEW card (card bodies
are immutable — corrections are new cards, not edits). One question approves
the whole batch.

**`distill`** — ship-time knowledge synthesis, run at or after `ship`/
`summit`. The output must read as if the repo never had planning
scaffolding. Inputs: shipped phases' locked decisions, plan outcomes, ledger
summaries, and decision/constraint cards. Outputs into `docs/`:
ARCHITECTURE.md (per-section merge — never clobbers hand-written content;
conflicts surface to you), one ADR per code-shaping locked decision
(referencing commits, not phase dirs), and CHANGELOG.md entries grouped by
milestone or phase. Everything is sanitized BEFORE writing — generated files
are scanned against the leak patterns, and any hit is rewritten to
public-safe form until the scanner passes clean. One confirmation shows the
diff summary before writing; a docs connector configured → the follow-up
offer is `/cairn:docs publish`.

**`brief [--stdout]`** — onboarding briefing for someone who wasn't there.
A view, not a source of truth — regenerated wholesale each run from
PROJECT.md, the roadmap, per-phase ledger one-liners, and high-confidence
decision/constraint cards (medium only when directly load-bearing). Output
is cache-stable (no volatile timestamps, stable ordering). Default writes
`docs/BRIEF.md` as a full overwrite; `--stdout` prints instead.

**`map build | "<question>" | diff | status`** — the project knowledge
graph: typed nodes (`module|phase|issue|decision|person`) and typed edges
(`depends-on|implements|decided-in|owns`) in one deterministic store. The
verb does the intelligence; the server only guarantees shape and atomicity,
and all writes go through the validated patch tool — never a direct file
edit. `build` walks the real sources (code structure, plan artifacts, the
tracker) and proposes only what the evidence supports; requirement →
decision and decision → module edges sourced from draft sessions are
first-class — the UAT traceability sweep depends on them. Nodes are chunked
across as many patches as you like, but **edges go in ONE final patch
carrying the complete list** — an edges array replaces the whole list, so a
partial edges chunk erases every edge written before it. `"<question>"`
answers in named terms from the stored graph — a missing answer is a build
gap, not a license to guess. `diff` rebuilds current truth in memory,
compares against the store, and names the drift; it never writes. `status`
reports counts plus staleness — a graph weeks behind the last commit is a
graph nobody should trust yet, and it says so plainly.

### Sessions & continuity

**`waypoint [resume]`** — manual session continuity. Bare `waypoint`
pauses: one batched question for `next_action` and `notes`, then a
checkpoint that merge-patches over the existing handoff; with
`continuity.wipCommits: true` and uncommitted work, it offers (never
auto-makes) a `wip(cairn):` commit. `waypoint resume` resumes: read the
handoff (none, or older than 14 days → say so, offer to inspect or discard,
stop), then cross-check the trust order — **the handoff is a hint, never
authority**: tracker + git log outrank the ledger, which outranks the
handoff. A handoff contradicting the tracker gets reported and corrected
before it's followed. On confirmed resume the handoff is cleared, and any
in-flight decisions it carried are offered as decision cards — the distill
moment a crash would otherwise have destroyed.

**`trace ["<bug>" | <id> | close <id>]`** — persistent debugging that
survives `/clear`, mirrored to the tracker in language a manager reads.
Start: a `cairn:bug` issue plus a session file, then the loop — `evidence`
FIRST (reproduce before hypothesizing) → `hypothesis` → `test` (an
experiment that can DISPROVE it) → repeat. Never two open hypotheses without
distinguishing evidence. Mirror touches at milestones only: "Investigation
started", "Cause identified", and the resolution on close. Resume (bare
`trace` or an id): the session file IS the context that survived — re-read
it and continue from the last entry. Close: fix landed with tests passing →
log a verdict (cause + fix + commit sha) → close (it mechanically refuses
without a verdict), then write the gotcha card with high confidence — it's
proven; that's what high means. Fast lane (cause already proven obvious AND
fix ≤3 lines): one evidence + one verdict + fix + close — one motion, full
paper trail.

**`thread "<name>" | (none = list open) | --wrap`** — persistent context
threads: the running memory for something that spans more sittings than your
context window does. Not a bug hunt, not a spike. Start creates a
`cairn:thread` issue; starting the same name while one is open is a resume,
not a duplicate — re-read the file and pick up from the last entry (no
mirror comment on resume; the tracker already knows). Entry discipline: log
as the work happens, not in a batch at the end — `note` (a fact worth
keeping), `link` (a reference PLUS one line of why it matters — a bare
reference is worthless six sittings from now), `decision` (a choice and its
reasoning, logged when made). Bare `thread` lists open threads from the
session landscape and offers a resume — a menu, not an action. `--wrap`
logs a wrap entry (the close gate) and closes with the resolution. Two
tracker touches total: start and wrap.

### Quality & governance

**`audit <mode> [target] | --fix`** — cross-phase quality audits: a
retro-check against what was already claimed done, not a new review invented
on the spot. Modes: `uat` (walk shipped flows as a user on a named platform
matrix — desktop + mobile viewport minimum — with a requirement-traceability
sweep; dispatched to the `cairn-uat` agent), `milestone` (goals vs delivered,
phase by phase), `security`/`ui`/`eval`/`validation` (re-check the phase's
OWN stated criteria — never a generic checklist substituted for the phase's
actual bar; `ui` adds the fidelity contract against the draft session's
decided direction and tokens.json), `tests` (find untested requirements and
WRITE the missing tests, not just flag them), `plans` (the plan-quality scan
for contract drift and unanchored thresholds, translated to plain language),
`docs` (sweep README/docs claims — tool counts, verb lists, paths, commands
— against the real codebase; drifted claims are findings). No target on a
phase-scoped mode = the most recently active phase. Closing discipline,
every mode, no exceptions: write the audit record (the record is the source
of truth; the tracker is the summary — and a clean `pass` still gets a
record, because that's the proof the audit ran), then one `cairn:audit`
issue per critical/important finding with the severity as the literal first
line of the body. Minor findings stay in the record only — a tracker full of
minors is a tracker nobody reads. `--fix`, only after the record exists:
mechanical fixes (obvious and small) land directly, one commit per finding,
comment + close; anything else is investigation-shaped and opens a trace —
never an improvised inline fix in between.

**`review [target] | --fix`** — five-axis code review: a fresh read against
the code as it stands (that's the difference from `audit`). Target
resolution: none = the working diff plus staged, full stop — no hunting for
a "more interesting" target; a branch name = that branch against `main`; a
phase number = the phase's ledgered commit ranges (read from the ledger, not
guessed). The five axes: correctness, clarity, architecture, security,
tests — a clean axis still gets a "no findings" line; silence isn't the same
as checked. Every finding is ranked critical/important/minor and names a
`file:line` plus a concrete failure scenario — a finding without a scenario
is a hunch; it gets downgraded or cut. Closing: critical/important →
`cairn:review` issues (severity first line, plain language — the scenario,
not the stack trace); minors stay in the record; the record is written every
time, clean or not, under a slugged scope. `--fix` follows audit's exact
two-shapes contract. Audience split worth knowing: `file:line` and the
verification detail live in the record (for engineers re-deriving the fix);
the issue body is for a manager triaging by severity.

**`triage [--stale-days N] | --apply`** — a health check on the tracker
itself. Sweeps open issues into classes: resolved-but-open (an evidence
rule, not a vibe — the session landscape or an audit record must name the
resolution; "feels fixed" is not evidence), stale (default 14 days,
`--stale-days` overrides — flag only, deliberately not config surface),
unlabeled, bodiless, unowned-in-progress, possible-duplicate (judgment, not
regex), and — on link-capable trackers — priority-inversion (an issue whose
declared priority is weaker than what it inherits through the dependency
chain, straight from `graph_report`; a P3 blocking a P1 is effectively P1).
Report always: a triage record plus a plain-language summary grouped
by class. **No new issues are ever created** — the one deliberate deviation
from audit/review's rule, because every triage finding already has a tracker
object: the issue itself. Filing an issue about an issue is noise. `--apply`
executes only the safe subset: best-fit labels from the vocabulary already
in use (never a new label name), one-line stale nudges, evidence-quoting
close comments then close for resolved-but-open, cross-linking comments on
BOTH ends of a possible duplicate, and a plain-language comment naming the
inheritance chain on a priority-inversion. Never-rules: duplicates are never
auto-closed; bodiless and unowned-in-progress are always report-only; every
close quotes its evidence first; priority labels are never rewritten — the
comment surfaces the inversion, raising the label is the human's move. When in doubt whether a finding qualifies
for `--apply`, it doesn't.

**`medic [--repair] | forensics [phase]`** — the planning directory's own
doctor. Bare `medic`: plan status, drift, plan checks, and ledger/file
cross-checks (does every phase have its ledger, plan, and directory? do
ledger commits still exist? a phase marked verified with no ledger evidence
is a finding, not a pass), ranked by what breaks next if ignored, closed
with a record. `--repair`, only after the health record exists, makes
exactly three mechanical moves: ensure a missing phase's tracker object,
scaffold missing files, relink stale plan↔issue links. **Structure, never
content**: it never rewrites what a plan says, never resolves a drift
finding by editing either side to match, never guesses what an ambiguous
state should mean — judgment-shaped findings are named "needs a human call."
`forensics [phase]` reconstructs what actually happened from three
witnesses — the ledger, git log over the phase's ranges, and tracker issue
history — and names any disagreement ("ledger says closed clean; git shows
two later commits touching the same files" is the shape of answer it
exists to produce). Forensics mutates nothing.

**`backtrack <phase|plan> | --apply`** — safe git undo scoped to what the
ledger says shipped — never a blind reset. The compute pass builds the
revert set from exactly the ledgered commits (nothing added because it
"looks related"), then runs the overlap check: any LATER commit touching a
file the revert set also touches is flagged file by file — overlap is never
resolved automatically; it means manual review, full stop. Nothing is
touched without `--apply`. `--apply` reverts one commit at a time,
newest-first (never a squashed revert — every original keeps its paired
revert in the log), runs the test suite (a red suite is reported, not
silently swallowed — and not "fixed" mid-run), mirrors a plain-language
comment to the affected issues, and writes a record. Never-rules: never
`git reset --hard`, never force-push, never anything outside the ledgered
manifest, and the remote is always untouched — pushing the reverts is your
call.

**`peers (none = status) | review [target] | plan <phase>`** — convene
external AI CLIs (codex, opencode, gemini, grok) as reviewers — a second
opinion on top of cairn's judgment, never a replacement. **A peer saying
something doesn't make it true**: every peer finding is verified against the
actual code (or plan) before it goes anywhere near the tracker. Bare
`peers`: detection status per provider (on PATH, enabled, input cap) — zero
peers is a normal result, not a warning. `peers review`: cairn's own
five-axis review runs FIRST, in full; the outbound content is leak-scanned
(a hit BLOCKS that send until you decide — redact and retry, or skip that
peer); each available peer reviews the same diff with the same finding
shape; every peer claim is judged adversarially; convergence runs at most
two rounds (a peer still disagreeing after round 2 is recorded as an open
disagreement, not given a round 3); survivors follow review's closing
discipline plus provenance — which peer, which round. `peers plan <phase>`:
same shape over PLAN.md — unambiguous verified critiques become plan edits;
anything opinionated enough that the plan's owner should decide becomes a
`cairn:audit` issue instead. Absent peers never block anything — the verb
degrades gracefully to "cairn reviewed this alone" and records the run as
usual.

### Workspaces & collaboration

**`basecamp init | focus <member> | dispatch | claim|update|done <id>`** —
multi-project workspaces and the parallel-workstream dispatch board — the
one verb that knows there's more than one project in the room. Bare
`basecamp` renders the board: per member, a focus marker, workstreams
grouped by status (queued/active/blocked/done), open-issue and open-session
counts; unconfigured members show up flagged, not hidden. No workspace is
not an error — cairn explains what one buys and offers `init` without
running it unasked. `init` is an interview-lite: it finds candidate member
directories (their own `cairn.json`, or an obvious project root), asks which
are members, and writes `cairn-workspace.json` at the root — nothing else;
each member keeps its own tracker-first setup untouched. `focus <member>`
repoints EVERY verb at that member — plan, work, issue calls, banner,
handoff — because they all resolve through the same project dir; nothing
downstream needs to know a workspace exists. `dispatch` decomposes a goal
into session-sized workstreams, queues them on the board, and prints
copy-pasteable per-session opener lines — it NEVER auto-spawns sessions.
The claim/update/done lifecycle runs from inside whichever session picked up
a workstream, with the discipline that matters: **focus is workspace-global,
last-write-wins, and another session can steal it between two of your tool
calls** — so before ANY tracker or board write, confirm focus still points
at YOUR member, and after claiming, re-read the board to confirm your
session tag won the race (if another tag appears, back off and pick
different work). Never claim a workstream that's already active.
`done` closes the issue and the board entry with the same plain-language
note — board and tracker tell one story.

### Docs & knowledge

**`docs publish [--name "<project>"] | (none = status)`** — mirror the
repo's documentation into the configured docs connector (Confluence or
Docusaurus).
Status reports the connector and landing page, or shows you the config block
shape if none is set. Publish: the project gets a folder named after it
under the space root; README.md becomes the landing page inside it; `docs/`
plus a root CHANGELOG.md become the child page tree; the landing page gains
a generated Documentation contents section. Images referenced by published
pages upload as real attachments (Confluence) or copy alongside the page
(Docusaurus) — the architecture diagrams under `docs/diagrams/` render
inline, not as broken links. Idempotent — re-publish updates pages in place
and never duplicates an attachment. `--name` overrides the project name
(default: repo directory name). Pairs naturally after `distill`. Full
detail in section 5.

### Configuration & health

**`tune [key] [value]`** — the config editor over `cairn.json`; all writes
go through the validated single-writer, never hand-edits. Bare `tune` shows
the effective config grouped (tracker/agents/memory/continuity/leakGuard)
with defaults marked, asks which group to change, batches that group's
edits into one question. `tune <key> <value>` is a direct dot-path set
(`tune continuity.resume auto`); `null` deletes a key; values are coerced to
the target type before patching — a wrong guess is rejected with
`CONFIG_INVALID` and the file stays untouched, so it's safe to be wrong.
Two named shortcuts: `tune leakguard off|on` (the leak guard's front door)
and `tune mode vibe|engineer` (the collaboration posture switch — engineer
requires `user.handle`; the server rejects the combination without it, and
tune asks for the handle and sets both in one patch). Credential-looking
keys or values are refused outright — secrets live in env vars.

**`profile`** — a developer profile: how you talk, what you already know,
what you'd rather not re-explain every session. Advisory only — it
calibrates tone and depth for every other verb, never what those verbs
decide. No tools: it writes `.cairn/profile.md` directly. It infers first —
README, contributing docs, linter configs, commit style from git log, test
framework, recent session history — and asks only what's left, in one
batched question (never a question the repo already answered). Sections:
communication, expertise, conventions, cadence — each inferred-or-asked,
never invented; an empty section beats a guessed one. Missing file is the
default state, not an error.

**`do "<request>"`** — the freeform smart router. Classifies your request
against the routing table and dispatches: read-only verbs with a clear match
run directly; mutating verbs or low confidence confirm first ("Sounds like
`/cairn:plan 4 --deep` — run it?"); no plausible match renders help.

**`help [verb]`** — the verb reference, rendered from the routing table.
With a typo, it nearest-matches ("`wrok` isn't a cairn verb — did you mean
`work`?"). With a verb name, it shows that verb's purpose, args, and
procedure summary. Bare, it renders the full reference in lifecycle order —
starting, always, with `/cairn:new`.

## 4. Tracker backends

Eight adapters behind one normalized interface, each declaring its
capabilities rather than pretending to a lowest common denominator. All
eight support issue comments. Credentials never live in `cairn.json` — the
config names *env vars*, and the adapter reads them at runtime. (The local
backend needs none at all.)

### Local

No accounts, no credentials, nothing to sign up for — issues live in your
repository as plain files. This is the zero-setup path, and it passes the
identical contract suite the hosted six pass:

```json
"tracker": { "type": "local", "config": { "dir": ".tracker", "prefix": "proj" } }
```

`dir` (default `.tracker`) is created on first use and **must be
committed** — it IS the tracker. `prefix` (2–10 lowercase alphanumerics)
forms issue ids like `proj-x7k2m`; the 5-character random suffix makes
simultaneous creation on different branches collision-safe.

The layout is deliberately boring: one directory per issue holding an
`issue.md` (readable frontmatter + markdown body — the blank line between
fields is what keeps concurrent edits merge-clean, don't "tidy" it), plus
one file per comment, worklog entry, and issue link. Concurrent work merges
with stock git: two branches creating issues, commenting the same issue,
or adding different links never conflict; two branches rewriting the same
field conflicts loudly on purpose — that's a real race a human should see.

Extras the hosted backends don't have yet: real issue links (`blocks`,
`parent-of`, `relates-to`, `supersedes`) and everything under "The
dependency graph" below. Time logged on close lands as real worklog files.

**Promotion — start local, graduate when the team grows.** One call,
`tracker_migrate(targetType, targetConfig)`, moves everything to a hosted
backend: phases first, then issues (states, labels, assignee, with the
phase references remapped), then comments and worklogs, then links —
native issue links where the target supports them, `[link]` comments where
it doesn't. Every migrated issue carries a `[migrated from <old-id>]`
backlink, and the full old→new id map lands in `.tracker/MIGRATED.json`.
`dryRun: true` reports counts without writing a thing. Honest caveat:
hosted comment APIs attribute writes to the API credential, so original
authors and timestamps survive as a `[<time> <author>]` prefix inside the
comment text, not as native metadata. The local store is never modified
beyond a `migratedTo` marker — writes still work afterward, with a warning
that they won't reach the new home.

### GitHub

```json
"tracker": { "type": "github", "config": { "repo": "owner/name" } }
```

Auth: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or an existing `gh auth login`. Phases map to
milestones. Assignee writes: supported. Issue listing paginates up to 1000
items.

### GitLab

```json
"tracker": {
  "type": "gitlab",
  "config": {
    "baseUrl": "https://gitlab.com",
    "project": "owner/name",
    "tokenEnv": "GITLAB_TOKEN",
    "extraLabels": []
  }
}
```

Auth: the env var named by `tokenEnv` (a personal access token with `api`
scope). `extraLabels` adds labels to every cairn-created issue. Assignee
writes: not yet mapped. Listing paginates up to 1000 items.

### Jira

```json
"tracker": {
  "type": "jira",
  "config": {
    "baseUrl": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
    "projectKey": "PROJ",
    "issueType": "Task",
    "emailEnv": "JIRA_EMAIL",
    "tokenEnv": "JIRA_API_TOKEN",
    "transitions": { "in_progress": "In Progress", "closed": "Done" }
  }
}
```

Auth: Atlassian email + API token via the named env vars. The `transitions`
map ties cairn's normalized states to your workflow's transition names —
if your board says "Doing" instead of "In Progress", say so here. Jira is
the one backend with **worklog support**: `issue_close` with a time spent
writes a real worklog entry (a worklog failure never fails a close that
already succeeded — the close comment's time line is the fallback
everywhere). Assignee writes: not yet mapped. Listing capped at 100 items.

**Sprint awareness:** cairn detects the project's board via the Agile API.
On a scrum board, new issues land in the active sprint automatically (no
active sprint → backlog); kanban boards behave as before. Multiple boards
on one project? Set `"boardId": <n>` in the config to pin the right one.
Sprint assignment is best-effort — an Agile-API hiccup logs a warning and
never fails the create. Epics are never sprinted.

**Estimates:** `issue_create`/`issue_update` accept story points + original
time estimates; points land in the site's story-point field (discovered
automatically, team- and company-managed variants), time in Jira's native
original-estimate — so burndown, velocity, and workload reports have real
data. Paired with worklog on close, estimate-vs-actual comes for free.

### Asana

```json
"tracker": {
  "type": "asana",
  "config": { "projectGid": "1234567890123456", "tokenEnv": "ASANA_TOKEN" }
}
```

Auth: personal access token via the named env var. Assignee writes: not yet
mapped. Listing capped at 100 items.

### Azure Boards

```json
"tracker": {
  "type": "azure-boards",
  "config": {
    "orgUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/your-org",
    "project": "your-project",
    "workItemType": "Issue",
    "patEnv": "AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT",
    "apiVersion": "7.0",
    "states": { "in_progress": "Doing", "closed": "Done", "open": "To Do" }
  }
}
```

Auth: a PAT with Work Items (Read & Write) scope via the named env var. The
`states` map plays the same role as Jira's `transitions` — normalized state
to your process's state names. Assignee writes: supported. Listing capped
at 100 items.

### ClickUp

```json
"tracker": {
  "type": "clickup",
  "config": {
    "defaultListId": "900123456",
    "spaceId": "90123456",
    "tokenEnv": "CLICKUP_TOKEN",
    "statuses": { "open": "to do", "in_progress": "in progress", "closed": "complete" }
  }
}
```

Auth: personal API token via the named env var. The `statuses` map ties
normalized states to your list's status names. Assignee writes: explicitly
deferred (needs numeric user-id resolution not yet implemented). Listing
capped at 100 items.

### Linear

```json
"tracker": {
  "type": "linear",
  "config": {
    "teamId": "9cfb482a-81e3-4154-b5b9-2c805e70a02d",
    "apiKeyEnv": "LINEAR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

Auth: personal API key via the named env var (sent raw — no Bearer prefix;
create one at linear.app/settings/api). Issues carry Linear's human
identifiers (`ENG-123`). No state map needed: cairn's states resolve
against the team's workflow automatically (in-progress → the team's
`started` state, close → `completed`). Phases are Linear **Projects**, with
a real phase close via the workspace's completed project status. First
hosted backend with native issue links — `blocks` and `relates-to` map to
Linear relations, `parent-of` to native sub-issues, so `graph_report`
(ready frontier, inherited priority) works here too; `supersedes` has no
Linear equivalent and degrades to a text backlink. Labels find-or-create
by name. Listing capped at 100 items.

### Capability differences at a glance

| Capability | Backends |
|---|---|
| Issue comments | all eight |
| Assignee **writes** | Local, GitHub, Azure Boards (others accept the call but don't propagate) |
| Worklog (real time entries on close) | Local, Jira |
| Estimates (story points + original time) | Local, Jira — populated at plan time; others ignore silently |
| Issue attachments (`issue_attach` — screenshots as evidence) | Local, Jira; audit ui/uat attach visual findings |
| Sprint awareness (creates land in the active sprint) | Jira scrum boards, auto-detected (`boardId` overrides) |
| Issue links + dependency graph | Local + Linear (`graph_report`; Linear lacks `supersedes`) |
| Native milestones | backend-dependent; `summit` records a skip when the phase primitive can't close, and `milestone_*` degrades gracefully |
| State mapping config | Jira `transitions`, Azure Boards `states`, ClickUp `statuses` (Linear resolves the team workflow automatically) |
| Issue-list cap (affects `plan_unplanned` completeness) | 1000 (GitHub/GitLab), 100 (Jira/Asana/Azure Boards/ClickUp/Linear) — truncation is logged to server stderr |

Adapter maturity, honestly stated: GitHub is live-green against a real
sandbox, and the local backend needs no live suite at all — its filesystem
IS the live backend, exercised directly by the unit, contract, and
merge-safety suites. The other six are fully implemented and pass the
unit and contract suites, but hadn't been run against live credentials at
the time of writing — run the env-gated live suite (`server/README.md` has the exact
commands per backend) before leaning on one in production. Two known risks
called out there: the Jira adapter uses a search endpoint Atlassian has
deprecated on Jira Cloud, and the Azure Boards iteration-parsing was
hardened speculatively against known API variance.

### The dependency graph

Backends with `hasDependencies` (the local tracker first — full section
coming with its setup docs) carry typed links between issues: `blocks`,
`parent-of`, `relates-to`, and `supersedes` for iteration lineage. On top
of them, `graph_report` answers three questions no flat issue list can:

- **What's ready right now?** The frontier — open issues whose blockers
  are all closed. `status` leads with it; it's the pick-next-work list.
- **What's actually urgent?** A P3 that blocks a P1 is effectively P1 —
  priority inherits through the `blocks` chain, and `status` shows the
  inheritance (`effectively P1, inherits from <id>`).
- **How did this idea evolve?** `supersedes` edges chain iterations
  oldest → newest, so an issue's whole lineage is one lookup.

Cycles are rejected the moment an edge would close one, and `medic` flags
(and `--repair` removes) edges whose endpoint issue no longer exists. Any
backend that grows `hasDependencies` later gets all of this for free — the
graph functions compute over the neutral SPI shapes, not the store.

---

## 5. Docs connectors — Confluence and Docusaurus, end to end

The docs connector publishes your repo's documentation outward to a team
wiki or docs site. It is deliberately a *sibling* of the tracker subsystem,
not an extension of it — trackers manage work items, docs connectors publish
documentation, and they share nothing but the HTTP core and the config
pattern. Two connectors ship today — Confluence (remote wiki, HTTP) and
Docusaurus (local static-site checkout, filesystem) — and the interface is
product-neutral (bodies cross it as markdown; each adapter owns conversion),
so Notion, GitBook, Slite, and SharePoint connectors can slot in behind the
same contract suite.

### Setup

Add a `docs:` block to `cairn.json` (the template ships it as `_docs` —
copy it over to `docs` to enable):

```json
"docs": {
  "connector": "confluence",
  "config": {
    "baseUrl": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki",
    "spaceKey": "DOCS",
    "emailEnv": "CONFLUENCE_EMAIL",
    "tokenEnv": "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

Then export the two env vars the config *names* (the names are yours to
choose; those are the defaults):

- your Atlassian account email
- an Atlassian API token (create one at Atlassian's API-token page)

Jira and Confluence share Atlassian API tokens — same-site users can point
these env names at their existing Jira credentials. The space named by
`spaceKey` must already exist; an unknown key fails with `NOT_FOUND` and a
pointer at the config.

A note on `spaceKey`: pages are matched by title and ancestry *within the
configured space*, and publish never deletes remote pages. Treat the space
key as settled once you've published — pointing the config at a different
space later doesn't move anything; it starts a fresh tree in the new space
and leaves the old one standing.

### What publish does

`/cairn:docs publish [--name "<project>"]`:

1. Your project gets a **folder named for the project** under the space
   root (looked up case-insensitively; created if absent). `--name`
   overrides the name; the default is the repo directory name.
2. `README.md` becomes the **landing page** inside that folder. The README
   is deliberately not part of the child tree — it's the front door.
3. `docs/` (plus a root `CHANGELOG.md` when present — distill writes both)
   becomes the **child page tree**, mirroring your directory structure.
   Directory pages get generated child listings.
4. The landing page gains a **Documentation contents** section with real
   page URLs — a two-pass publish, since the links don't exist until the
   children do.

**Ordering:** directory entries are sorted lexically, so numeric filename
prefixes (`01-runbook.md`, `02-adr/`…) control page order in the tree and
in generated contents sections. The prefix (and the `.md` extension) is
stripped from the page title; the title itself is the file's first H1 when
it has one, else derived from the filename. Dotfiles are skipped.

**Idempotency:** pages are matched by title + ancestry and updated in
place — re-publishing is safe and is the normal way to push doc updates.

**Title conflicts:** Confluence titles are unique per *space*, not per
parent. When your page's title is already taken elsewhere in the space, the
page publishes under a `Title (Context)` disambiguation instead of failing
— the verb mentions any suffixed titles in its report.

**What publish does NOT do:** delete anything remotely. When local files
disappear, their remote pages remain — the verb notes stale pages for
manual cleanup when the tree shrinks.

**Conversion:** a dependency-free markdown → Confluence storage-format
converter handles headings, paragraphs, nested lists, fenced code (as a
code macro), tables, blockquotes, and links. Images degrade to links;
unknown constructs degrade to escaped text. Conversion never throws — worst
case you get plainer output, not a failed publish.

### Docusaurus

Why would a static-site generator need a *connector* at all? Because
Docusaurus has no page API — the site's `docs/` folder IS the database, and
the community-recommended way to feed it from a tool is simply to write
markdown files into that folder and let the site's own CI build and deploy.
That's exactly what this connector does…

```json
"docs": {
  "connector": "docusaurus",
  "config": {
    "sitePath": "../my-docs-site",
    "docsDir": "docs",
    "autoCommit": false
  }
}
```

- `sitePath` — path to your Docusaurus site checkout (absolute, or relative
  to the cairn project). It must contain a `docusaurus.config.js|ts|mjs`;
  publish fails with `CONFIG_INVALID` otherwise. No credentials — there is
  no remote.
- `docsDir` (default `docs`) — the docs root inside the site; created if
  missing.
- `autoCommit` (default `false`) — after a successful publish, commit the
  project folder in the *site's* repo (`docs(cairn): publish <project>`).
  It never pushes, and a failed commit (not a repo, hooks, whatever) never
  fails the publish — it degrades to a `warning` on the publish result.

**The mapping:** your project becomes one folder,
`<docsDir>/<project-slug>/`, with a `_category_.json` carrying the project
name. The README becomes the folder's `index.md` (Docusaurus's native
category landing page), each doc file becomes a `.md` page with front
matter (`title`, `sidebar_position` in publish order), and each doc
directory becomes a nested folder — empty directories get a
`_category_.json` with a `generated-index` link so Docusaurus renders the
contents page itself. No generated TOC markdown anywhere: the sidebar and
generated indexes are the navigation, which is the whole point of the
`hasNativeToc` capability.

**Filenames mirror your repo:** published files keep their source names
(`docs/00-quickstart.md` publishes as `00-quickstart.md`, not a
title-derived slug), so repo-relative links *between* your docs keep
resolving on the published site. Every page also opts into CommonMark via
`mdx.format: md` front matter — raw markdown with literal `<angle>`
brackets never hits the MDX parser.

**Broken-link policy:** links that point *outside* `docs/` (a
`../README.md`, a source-file reference) can't resolve on a static site.
Docusaurus fails the build on these by default — set `onBrokenLinks:
'warn'` in `docusaurus.config.js` (the standard setting for imported
content), or keep doc links inside `docs/`.

**Ownership:** everything under `<docsDir>/<project-slug>/` is
cairn-managed and overwritten on re-publish; the connector never touches a
file outside that folder. Hand-written pages elsewhere in the site are
safe.

**v1 limits:** no attachments, no versioned-docs/i18n trees, and page URLs
in the publish report are file paths (the real site URL needs a built
site).

### Status and errors

Bare `/cairn:docs` reports the connector and the landing page (title +
link) or "not yet published"; with no `docs:` block it shows you the block
shape. `CONFIG_MISSING` → add the block. `AUTH_MISSING` → the message names
the exact env vars to export.

## 6. Memory

Cairn's memory is engineered against context rot: the failure mode where an
assistant's "knowledge" quietly drifts out of sync with the code and nobody
notices. Two tiers, different durability guarantees:

| Tier | Store | Lifetime | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — index | SQLite full-text index at `~/.cairn/index/` (outside the repo) | disposable, rebuildable | reference-grade bulk you'll cite later: docs, API surfaces, research dumps |
| 2 — cards | `.cairn/memory/cards/*.md`, git-committed | durable | single facts: decisions, constraints, gotchas, references |

Never index logs, test output, or build output — that's ephemeral; read it,
act on it, don't persist it.

**Cards** are frontmatter'd markdown files, one fact each — not session
summaries. Types: `decision`, `constraint`, `gotcha`, `reference`, and
`note` (un-triaged jottings from `mark --note` — cheap to write, first to
prune). Every card may carry a `confidence` of high/medium/low, surfaced at
recall and re-graded only by `retro`, never silently. Card ids are content
hashes of the body, so re-creating an identical card never duplicates —
and **bodies are immutable**: the only mutation a card ever gets is a
confidence re-grade. A changed lesson is a new card.

**Provenance + staleness — the anti-rot headline.** Cards record the files
and commits that back them. Every recall re-verifies that provenance
against the current repo (a git diff since the recorded commit) and serves
`stale: true` with reasons when the code has moved. Never treat a stale
card as ground truth — re-verify the claim, then update (rewrite) or retire
the card. A stale card left unaddressed is worse than no card. Memory can
be wrong; it can never silently lie.

**Scoped recall.** Search the task at hand, not the whole project's noise:
recall scopes issue > phase > project, widening only when the narrow search
comes up empty. A pre-rendered recall banner (capped at
`continuity.recallIndex.maxCards`) is injected at session start at a known
token cost — with honest accounting of what the banner saves versus
injecting every card in full.

**Distill-then-drop.** At issue close and phase transition, ask "what here
deserves a card?" Write the card with provenance; then let the old index
scope simply stop being searched. No deletion needed — tier 1 is
disposable by design, which is also why losing the index loses nothing.

**Capacity guard.** `memory.tokenThreshold` (default 150,000) is the
advisory line: when the index's approximate token usage crosses it, the
recommendation is to split the active issue into sub-tasks rather than
piling more work into one context. Advisory means advisory — the tool can't
pause you; you act on the signal.

One care-and-feeding note: cards are git-committed, so treat them like
code — review, PR, don't hand-edit frontmatter into malformed shapes. A
malformed card silently drops out of recall rather than erroring; check
`git status`/`git diff` after hand-editing one.

---

## 7. Continuity & sessions

### Session continuity (the crash-proof part)

Kill a session mid-task — compaction, usage cap, `/clear`, a real crash —
and the next session resumes at the exact task with zero re-executed work.
The server is the primary writer: every state-changing tool refreshes a
per-machine handoff file, write-through, on every call. Hooks cover the
gaps: a throttled breadcrumb after Edit/Write/Bash calls, an unthrottled
refresh right before compaction, and a session-start hook that prints the
handoff and — per `continuity.resume` — offers (`prompt`), auto-runs
(`auto`), or suppresses (`off`) the resume. Every hook is fire-and-forget
and targets under 100ms; a hook failure is never visible to your session.

Guard rails worth knowing:

- **Skeleton guard** — a write can never replace a rich handoff with an
  empty one; richness is monotonic between clears.
- **Unregistered guard** — nothing is ever created for a project without a
  loadable `cairn.json`.
- **Never trusted blind** — a handoff older than 14 days is surfaced as
  stale and never auto-resumed, even with `resume: "auto"`. And the trust
  order on any resume is: tracker + git log > LEDGER.md > handoff.

`ship` and `summit` clear the handoff — shipping ends the session.
`/cairn:waypoint` is the manual pause/resume path (section 3).

### The four session kinds

Four persistent, typed session kinds share one core: a git-side session
file (append-only typed entries), a tracker mirror in plain language, and a
mechanical close gate — a session *cannot* close without its gate entry
logged first.

| Kind | Directory | Entry kinds | Close gate | Tracker label | Reach for it when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trace` | `.cairn/trace/` | evidence, hypothesis, test, verdict | ≥1 verdict | `cairn:bug` | debugging anything — a failed verify, a reported bug, a mid-work discovery |
| `probe` | `.cairn/probe/` | experiment, result, requirement, verdict | ≥1 verdict | `cairn:spike` | you'd otherwise be guessing — a risky assumption worth a throwaway experiment |
| `draft` | `.cairn/draft/` | variant, decision, note | ≥1 decision | `cairn:sketch` | a design direction needs comparing options side by side |
| `thread` | `.cairn/thread/` | note, link, decision, wrap | ≥1 wrap | `cairn:thread` | context must outlive more sittings than your context window does |

Session ids are description-derived hashes, and starting the same
description twice while a session is open refuses with a pointer at the
existing session (for threads, that refusal *is* the resume path — by
design). Archives are immutable: closing appends a resolution block and
moves the file to the kind's `archive/` directory. Probe and draft artifact
directories survive the close until `--wrap` packages what's worth keeping
into a project skill — after which deletion is offered, never automatic.

The tracker mirror across all kinds is milestone-only and verb-driven:
comment on start, a key-finding/decision comment mid-session, and the
resolution rides the close (threads collapse to two touches — start and
wrap). Plain language on every mirror touch: no code blocks, no file paths,
no internal refs a non-engineer would bounce off of. The detail lives in
the session log; the tracker gets the story.

`session_landscape` is the read-only join over all four kinds and the
single source of truth for what's open — `status`, frontier modes, and
thread listing all read it rather than reconstructing from disk or memory.

---

## 8. Quality machinery

### Verify's posture

Goal-backward, always: the question is "does the codebase deliver what the
phase PROMISED," never "did the tasks close." Depth raises the bar — quick
is tests-pass, standard adds the tracker cross-check, deep adds an
adversarial verification subagent. VERIFICATION.md is written only on a
pass, and a failed verify mandatorily becomes a trace.

### Drift

Drift is a stop signal, not a warning. The drift scan reads every phase's
referenced tracker issues and flags two things: **missing** (the issue no
longer exists — remedy: recreate it and relink) and **closed-unverified**
(the issue is closed but its phase has no VERIFICATION.md — remedy: verify
the phase, or reopen the issue). The presence of VERIFICATION.md is the
human-controlled contract that makes closed issues normal. `plan`, `ship`,
`status`, and `medic` all consume the same scan; `ship` refuses to push
over it.

### TDD gates

Eligibility is decided per task at plan time (`plan --tdd`) and stored in
PLAN.md frontmatter. Work time enforces RED → GREEN → REFACTOR as separate
commits with the RED and GREEN shas recorded in the ledger at close. Verify
enforces the evidence: every TDD task's ledger line must carry its
`tdd <red>..<green>` segment, or the phase fails — no exceptions, no
retroactive forgiveness. The ledger is the evidence chain.

### Audits, reviews, triage

Three distinct instruments — worth keeping straight:

- **`audit`** is a retro-check against what was already claimed done (eight
  modes, section 3), including the fidelity contract for UI (shipped UI vs
  the draft session's decided direction and tokens.json) and the docs sweep
  (README claims vs the real codebase).
- **`review`** is a fresh five-axis read of a diff, branch, or phase —
  correctness, clarity, architecture, security, tests — every finding with
  a file:line and a concrete failure scenario, or it's a hunch and gets cut.
- **`triage`** is tracker hygiene — and the one place findings never become
  new issues, because each finding already *is* an issue.

All three close through the same record store: `.cairn/audit/` files, one
per scope per day (same scope re-run the same day supersedes; prior dates
untouched). A `pass` verdict still writes the record — the record is the
proof the check ran. Critical/important findings mirror to the tracker with
the severity as the literal first line; minors stay in the record. The
`--fix` contract everywhere is two shapes only: mechanical (fix, commit per
finding, comment, close) or investigation-shaped (open a trace). Not
clearly mechanical means investigation-shaped by default — the safe side to
be wrong on.

The plan-quality scan behind `audit plans` runs two deterministic
detectors: **contract drift** (a consumer's Produces/Consumes contract text
sharing a named symbol with a producer's but not matching it) and
**unanchored thresholds** (a quantitative bound — `< 100ms`, `at least
99.9%` — with no benchmark, fixture, spec, or measurement anchor nearby).
Deterministically ordered, byte-equal across runs on an unchanged tree.

### Peers

External AI CLIs as reviewers, with three hard properties: cairn's own
review always runs first and in full; every outbound send passes the leak
gate (a hit blocks the send until you decide); and every inbound claim is
judged adversarially against the real code, with a two-round convergence
cap. Missing peers never block anything.

---

## 9. Collaboration

### Vibe vs engineer mode

`user.mode` picks the posture. **Vibe** (default): cairn drives end to end;
judgment calls resolve silently. **Engineer**: you claim issues, write
code, and make the design calls; cairn pairs, scaffolds, verifies, and
keeps the tracker mirror honest for both parties' work. Concretely,
engineer mode changes four things:

1. **Claiming** — `work` asks "mine or yours?" once per wave/phase; your
   issues get scaffolding (branch, in-progress, a claim comment carrying
   the task context and, for TDD tasks, the failing test) and then cairn
   steps back.
2. **No-self-merge** — cairn's finished work lands as a PR naming you as
   reviewer and does not merge; `ship` stops while any cairn-authored PR
   awaits review; `auto` treats a waiting PR as a natural stop.
3. **Decision surfacing** — genuine design forks stop and ask, options with
   trade-offs, cairn's recommendation first. Boilerplate stays automatic.
4. **Closing your work** — when you're done, cairn runs the tests and
   verify posture against it, closes with evidence and time logged on your
   behalf, and offers (never forces) a review.

Engineer mode requires `user.handle` — set both with
`/cairn:tune mode engineer`.

### Ownership and courtesy

Claiming an unassigned issue (any verb that moves it to in-progress)
auto-assigns it to the working user, so the tracker shows who holds what
without anyone remembering to assign. Identity comes from `user.handle`
when set; otherwise it's derived from the tracker credentials themselves —
Jira resolves the authenticated account (`/myself` → accountId, and an
email handle is resolved to an accountId automatically), GitHub uses the
token's login, Azure Boards the signed-in account. GitLab and ClickUp
don't support assignee writes yet (numeric-id resolution pending). The
rules: an explicit assignee always wins, an already-assigned issue is
never touched, and an identity-lookup failure never blocks the claim —
the result carries `autoAssigned: true` when it fired.

With `user.handle` set, cairn also skips issues assigned to someone else
unless you explicitly override — never silently. Without a handle,
ownership checks are off (auto-assign still works via credential-derived
identity where the backend supports it). Work-state
concurrency (two agents starting the same issue) is the tracker's job — the
in-progress state transition is the atomic claim; cairn reads the
tracker's truth. Plans and memory cards collaborate through ordinary git:
push, PR, review, merge. No locking machinery, on purpose.

### Workspaces

`basecamp` (section 3) adds the multi-project layer: a workspace file
naming member projects, a focus that repoints every verb, a dispatch board
for parallel workstreams, and the focus-discipline rules that keep N
parallel sessions from trampling each other. The compatibility guarantee is
absolute: with no workspace file anywhere above your launch directory,
nothing changes — every single-project setup behaves identically.

### Import and unplanned work

`import` reverse-mirrors tracker-origin work into cairn; `plan_unplanned`
surfacing (via `status` and `plan`) catches tracker issues no plan
references — work at risk of being missed. Between them, cairn joins teams
mid-stream instead of demanding a greenfield.

## 10. cairn.json — complete reference

One file at the repo root, validated on every read and every write. All
writes go through the config tools (`/cairn:tune`), which validate the
*merged* result before touching the file — an invalid patch changes
nothing.

| Key | Type | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tracker.type` | `github \| gitlab \| jira \| asana \| azure-boards \| clickup \| linear \| local` | *(required)* | Which tracker adapter runs |
| `tracker.config` | object | *(required)* | Backend-specific config (section 4); deep validation lives in the adapter |
| `docs.connector` | `confluence` \| `docusaurus` | *(optional block)* | Which docs connector runs |
| `docs.config` | object | — | Connector config: `baseUrl`, `spaceKey`, `emailEnv` (default `CONFLUENCE_EMAIL`), `tokenEnv` (default `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN`) |
| `agents.model` | `auto \| inherit \| haiku \| sonnet \| opus` | `auto` | Model routing for agent fan-out. `inherit` = session model everywhere; an explicit value pins everything; `auto` routes per work class: mechanical → fast tier, synthesis → session tier, judgment gates → strongest. Blast-radius rule: output that gates verify/ship routes UP, never down; uncertain → inherit |
| `memory.tokenThreshold` | positive integer | `150000` | The capacity-guard advisory line for the memory index |
| `user.handle` | non-empty string | *(optional)* | Your tracker identity — enables ownership tracking, claiming, skip-others'-work |
| `user.mode` | `vibe \| engineer` | absent ≡ `vibe` | Collaboration posture (section 9). Engineer requires `handle` |
| `continuity.resume` | `prompt \| auto \| off` | `prompt` | Session-start resume behavior: ask, proceed, or suppress |
| `continuity.checkpoint` | boolean | `true` | The post-tool-use breadcrumb hook |
| `continuity.wipCommits` | boolean | `false` | Whether `waypoint` offers a `wip(cairn):` commit on pause |
| `continuity.recallIndex.enabled` | boolean | `true` | The session-start memory banner |
| `continuity.recallIndex.maxCards` | positive integer | `20` | Banner card cap |
| `leakGuard.enabled` | boolean | `true` | The commit-time leak guard hook |
| `leakGuard.allow` | string[] | `[]` | Path globs exempt from the guard |
| `leakGuard.extraPatterns` | string[] | `[]` | Additional regex patterns to guard against |
| `peers.<provider>.enabled` | boolean | `true` when absent | Per-provider toggle; providers: `codex`, `opencode`, `gemini`, `grok` — unknown keys are rejected |
| `peers.<provider>.maxInputChars` | positive integer | `200000` | Input cap per provider; longer input is head-truncated with a verbatim marker line |

**The secrets-in-env rule, enforced:** config writes refuse any
credential-shaped key (`token`, `apiToken`, `api_key`, `password`,
`secret`, `pat`, …) and any value matching known token prefixes (GitHub,
GitLab, Atlassian, Slack, `sk-` keys). Config carries env var *names*; the
env carries the secrets. There is no override.

About the leak guard, since it's the config block people meet first: it
fires only on `git commit` calls, scanning the staged diff's added lines
for cairn-internal references — `.cairn/` paths, phase-directory refs,
cairn label strings, and your backend's issue-id pattern (for GitHub, bare
`#N` is deliberately not matched — "fixes #123" is legitimate). Allowlisted
paths (`.cairn/**`, `docs/**`, `*.md`, ledger/verification artifacts) are
skipped. A hit blocks the commit with an exact `file:line: [pattern]`
listing. Escape hatches: `tune leakguard off`, the `allow`/`extraPatterns`
config keys, or a one-shot `CAIRN_LEAK_OK=1 ` *prefix* on the commit
command (mentioning the variable elsewhere — say, quoted inside the commit
message — does not bypass). Accepted limitation: commits made outside
Claude Code are unguarded.

## 11. Error codes & troubleshooting

Every server tool fails with a typed `CairnError`: a code, a message, and
usually a `nextAction` telling you what to do. Verbs surface these — never
stack traces.

| Code | Meaning | Your next move |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_MISSING` | No readable `cairn.json` in the project dir | Create one from `templates/cairn.json.example` |
| `CONFIG_INVALID` | `cairn.json` (or a config patch, workspace file, or stale focus) failed validation — bad JSON, wrong types, a secret where a secret doesn't belong, a malformed `cairn-workspace.json`, or a focus naming a vanished member | Read the message — it names the exact path and problem. The file is left untouched on a rejected patch, so fix and retry |
| `AUTH_MISSING` | A required credential env var isn't set | The message names the exact env vars to export (and where to mint the token) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | The backend is throttling | Wait and retry; the shared HTTP core already retries with backoff before this surfaces |
| `NOT_FOUND` | The named thing doesn't exist — an issue id, a card id, a session id, a Confluence space | Check the identifier; for spaces, check `docs.config.spaceKey` |
| `TRACKER_DOWN` | The backend is unreachable or erroring | Git-side operations continue; retry the tracker work when it's back. Verbs report and keep what they can |
| `HANDOFF_INVALID` | The continuity handoff file is malformed | Inspect or discard it; a fresh checkpoint rewrites it |
| `HANDOFF_STALE` | The handoff is too old to trust | Inspect or discard — stale handoffs are never auto-resumed |
| `UNSUPPORTED` | The operation isn't valid here — e.g. an invalid node/edge type in a map patch, or a capability the backend doesn't have | Use a supported type/path; capability differences are in section 4 |
| `PRECONDITION_FAILED` | The operation's gate isn't satisfied — unverified phases at summit, closing a session without its gate entry, starting a duplicate open session, a map patch with dangling edges, board writes without a workspace, a peer that isn't on PATH / is disabled / timed out | The message names the gate. Satisfy it and re-run — these operations are built to be safely re-runnable |

### Common failure scenarios

**Missing env vars.** The first tracker or docs call fails `AUTH_MISSING`
with the exact names to export. Export them and re-run — nothing partial
happened.

**Drift flags mid-flow.** `plan`, `ship`, or `status` reports missing or
closed-unverified issues. Reconcile before proceeding: recreate + relink
missing issues; for closed-unverified, either verify the phase or reopen
the issue. `ship` will not push over drift, full stop.

**`PRECONDITION_FAILED` on summit.** At least one phase lacks
VERIFICATION.md. Run `/cairn:verify <N>` for each listed phase, then re-run
summit — milestone completion is idempotent, so re-running after a partial
tracker failure is safe too.

**Tracker down mid-work.** The current issue's tracker writes fail
`TRACKER_DOWN`; git-side work, plans, memory, and sessions continue
untouched (one backend being down never blocks git-side operations). The
verb reports what it couldn't mirror; when the tracker returns, the close
comments and state transitions catch up — and `resync`'s cursor means
nothing external that changed meanwhile gets lost.

**Session refuses to close.** Every session kind mechanically requires its
gate entry (verdict / decision / wrap) before closing. Log the gate entry —
that's the whole design: no session ends without its conclusion written
down.

**Stolen basecamp focus.** In parallel-dispatch topology, another session's
focus switch can repoint yours between calls. The discipline in section 3
(confirm focus before every write; re-read the board after claiming) is the
fix; a lost claim race means back off and pick different work.

**Planning directory looks wrong.** `/cairn:medic` for the diagnosis,
`medic --repair` for the mechanical subset, `medic forensics <phase>` when
you need to know what actually happened versus what the docs claim.

That's the whole machine. Start with `/cairn:new` (or `/cairn:import` if
the work already exists), keep the loop honest — plan, work, verify, ship —
and let the gates do their job. They're not there to slow you down; they're
there so that when something says "done," it actually is…
